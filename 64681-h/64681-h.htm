<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />


<small>JESSICA BEGINS A LONG JOURNEY.</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;O mother! How can I bear it? How can I go?&#8221;
cried Jessica Trent, clinging fast to the slender, black-robed
figure standing a little apart on the platform of the
railway station.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravely and hopefully, my darling, as befits the
daughter of Cassius Trent. Eagerly, I trust, as one who
goes to finish his life work;&#8221; answered the almost heart-broken
mother, the joy of whose existence would vanish
with that outgoing eastern train.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I may come home again next year, mother
dearest? Say I may come then!&#8221; pleaded the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it seems best,&#8221; answered Gabriella Trent, tenderly
stroking the fair cheek which seemed to have grown
thinner and whiter during these last days before this
parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next year? Why, my suz! You won&#8217;t much more
than get there by that time, child alive. Three thousand
miles is pretty consid&#8217;able of a step, seems if,&#8221; commented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
a voice which tried to be as cheerful as it was
loud. But the words ended with a sob; that &#8220;three
thousand miles,&#8221; which her own fancy had pictured quite
breaking down the composure of Aunt Sally Benton,
who had come with the rest of the Sobrante party to
see Jessica Trent off for the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blow my stripes! If I ever knew there were so many
folks all agog for travelin&#8217;! Uneasiest crowd &#8217;t ever
I see an&#8217; noisiest. Well, captain, I hope they&#8217;ll get
talked out &#8217;fore sleeping time comes. If a body can
sleep aboard a train of cars. Give me a good ship now&mdash;then
you sing! Here, you fool! What you jostlin&#8217;
into me for? Think this whole platform belongs to you,
just because you&#8217;re one the know-nothin&#8217; towerists?&#8221;
cried Samson, the mighty herder and one-time sailor,
as an anxious &#8220;tourist&#8221; bumped an armful of luggage
against him.</p>

<p>A big crowd it certainly was. Mainly a happy and
eager one as well; its winter&#8217;s outing and sight-seeing
over, and home-going at hand. A few, indeed, were
sad. Those who had come to California seeking health
for some beloved one and failing to find it; leaving the
helpless one to take his last sleep in that sunny land,
or to carry him eastward to die under native skies.</p>

<p>But amid all the bustle and haste the group from Sobrante
was quiet and separate, only Aunt Sally and
Samson now and then breaking out into exclamations to
relieve their overwrought emotions, and thereby attracting
more attention than Mrs. Trent quite enjoyed.</p>

<p>Indeed, she would have preferred to keep these last
moments to herself and Jessica alone, but could not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
All the &#8220;boys&#8221; who could possibly be spared from the
ranch had come to Los Angeles to see their little &#8220;Captain&#8221;
depart; although John Benton, the carpenter, emphatically
declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a downright mistake. As if our &#8216;Lady Jess&#8217;
didn&#8217;t know more now than any &#8216;finished&#8217; boardin&#8217;
school miss could even guess at. Figures? Huh! What
does she need more&#8217;n to add up a few wages now an&#8217;
again, and she&#8217;s a likely head at that already. Sent
&#8217;way off to New York after an education that she could
get right here in Californy if her mother&#8217;d only think
so. I don&#8217;t hold with no such unnatural separations, I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to the girl herself, it seemed to all these devoted
henchmen that she had grown suddenly older, graver,
more dignified, almost careworn. On that very last day
of all, when she had made a detailed visit to, and inspection
of, every part of the big ranch, she had done so with
a quiet, critical interest quite contrary to her usual
careless gayety.</p>

<p>&#8220;This paddock needs attention, &#8216;boy.&#8217; You mustn&#8217;t
let things go to ruin while I&#8217;m away nor expect mother to
look after them,&#8221; she had warned one ranchman, in a
tone he had never heard her use before. Also, she had
gone over his books with the man who now &#8220;plucked&#8221;
the ostriches, whose feathers were such an important
factor in the family income, and finding his accounts
slightly incorrect had reprimanded him sharply.</p>

<p>It had been altogether another Jessica during these last
days; but all felt her altered manner was due wholly
to the grief of her home-leaving; and John Benton was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
not the only one of the devoted &#8220;boys&#8221; who considered
her departure a mistake.</p>

<p>However, mistake or not, it was now at hand. A
distant whistle sounded. The southern San Diego train
was coming in, the outgoing overland express stood waiting
on the rails before the platform, and by one impulse
the whole Sobrante party grouped about the girl for
a final kiss or hand-shake. To each and all of them
she represented the best of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anybody harms or tries to harm a hair of your
curly yellow head, my Lady Jess, just you telegrapht
me to once an&#8217; I&#8217;ll take the trail eastward, lickety-cut!&#8221;
cried George Cromarty, with a suspicious moisture in
his usually merry eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ve got a brother yender, in the State o&#8217; Maine.
Like&#8217;s not I&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; a trip that way myself, little
captain, if I find Sobrante gets too lonesome,&#8221; said Joe,
the smith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be sure you keep that bottle of picra right side up,
just the way I fixed it in your satchel, an&#8217; take a dose
if you feel a mite car sick, or homesick, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any other kind of sick!&#8221; interrupted John Benton,
coolly pushing Aunt Sally aside, that he might get hold
of Jessica himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s dried peach turnovers in that basket an&#8217;
some my hen chicken&#8217;s best hard-boiled eggs in Mr.
Hale&#8217;s suit case!&#8221; almost screamed Mrs. Benton as the
whole party moved forward toward the train. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a jar of picked-off roast quail and&mdash;Good-by, Jessie
Trent! Good-by! Don&#8217;t take no sass from nobody and
do, I beg of you, do keep&mdash;your stockin&#8217;s&mdash;mended;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Oh! my stars an&#8217; garters! Oh! my! my suz!&#8221; wailed
the poor woman, as the girl she so dearly loved was
swept away from her without even one parting hug.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Trent, to whom this farewell meant more
than to any of them, had now no word to say. One
silent, prolonged clasp of her daughter&#8217;s little figure,
one light kiss on the pretty lips, and&mdash;Jessica was
gone!</p>

<p>The dying rumble of the overland seemed a knell of
all her happiness and for a moment, as she stood with
closed eyes trying to collect herself, she had a reckless
impulse to board the next outgoing train and follow
on her darling&#8217;s &#8220;trail.&#8221; Then somebody touched her
arm and Ninian Sharp was saying in tones that tried
to be cheerful and failed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear madam. Our girl has put you into my
especial care and the first thing on the docket is dinner.
It was a poor breakfast any of us made and I, for
one, am hungry. Come on, boys. It&#8217;s the Westminster&mdash;for
all of us. Here? Ready, every one? This car
then for you and we&#8217;ll meet you there. Come, Aunt
Sally. Eh? What?&#8221;</p>

<p>For as the one-time reporter of the <i>Lancet</i>, and now
manager of the Sobrante, hailed a carriage to convey
Mrs. Trent and Mrs. Benton hotel-ward, the latter
fell into a tragic attitude and wildly waved her &#8220;reticule&#8221;
eastward, whither Jessica&#8217;s train had gone, and as
wildly thrust her free hand skyward, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ought to be kicked by cripples! I certainly had!
If I ain&#8217;t the foolishest, forgettin&#8217;est woman &#8217;twixt the
two oceans! An&#8217; it&#8217;s too late now. Oh! my suz a-me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>Mr. Ninian laughed, and was more grateful to Aunt
Sally just then than he had ever been before. Her
evident, if comical, distress interrupted sadder thoughts
and he promptly demanded, again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s wrong now, neighbor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t think you, nor no other sensible person&#8217;d
want to go &#8216;neighborin&#8217;&#8217; me, a body that can&#8217;t keep
her wits about her no longer &#8217;n what I can. Gabriella
Trent, I&#8217;ve clean gone, or gone an&#8217; clean forgot, that
pink-and-white patchwork quilt I&#8217;ve been settin&#8217; up
nights to get ready for Jessie to take with her on the
cars, to sleep in! Now&mdash;what do you say to that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The dramatic dismay on the good woman&#8217;s countenance
sent Mr. Sharp into a roar of laughter which, this
time, was wholly unfeigned, and even brought a smile
of amusement to Mrs. Trent&#8217;s pale face. The picture
her fancy evoked of pretty, fair-haired Jessica, bundled
in the patchwork quilt on board a luxurious &#8220;sleeper&#8221;
was so absurd that she forgot, for the moment, other and
graver matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder, dear, with all the things you did and
looked after, so that we might both leave home&mdash;no
wonder you forgot. It was very kind of you to take
so much trouble for the child, but she&#8217;ll not really need
the quilt. The beds are well fitted on the sleepers, and
Mr. Hale will care for her as if she were his own. Come.
We mustn&#8217;t keep Mr. Ninian waiting and after dinner
he wants me to meet one or two business men. About
the mine, you know;&#8221; explained Gabriella, entering the
carriage, whither Aunt Sally clumsily followed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, that big-hearted creature could always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
find a &#8220;way out&#8221; of most difficulties, and she promptly
settled the quilt question, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if she didn&#8217;t get it for a keepsake gift, it&#8217;s
hern all the same and she shall have it a-Christmas, and
you needn&#8217;t touch to tell me she shan&#8217;t. Even if I be
to &#8216;Boston,&#8217; come that day, an&#8217; I have to badger the very
life out of my son John to get him to send it to her then.
But dinner, Gabriell&#8217;! I don&#8217;t feel as if I could eat
a single bite. Do you, yourself, honey?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Ninian felt as if he could shake her. He
knew that it would be small appetite, indeed, Mrs.
Trent would bring even to that fine menu he meant to
lay before her, and here was thoughtless Aunt Sally
almost intimating that dining at all would, to-day, be
an indecency. So there was more real feeling than
appeared in his rejoinder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mrs. Benton! I wager that with all your
present &#8216;suffering&#8217; you&#8217;ll yet be able to make a good
square meal. One, maybe, that it&#8217;ll tax my pocket-book
to pay for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoity-toity, young man! Who&#8217;s asked you to pay
for my victuals? I didn&#8217;t; and more&#8217;n that it&#8217;s my intent
and cal&#8217;lation to pay spot cash not only for what I eat
but what Gabrielly does, too, and &#8217;twon&#8217;t be my fault
if she don&#8217;t get urged to fair stuff herself. So there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough, Aunt Sally! You&#8217;re a&mdash;a brick!&#8221;
retorted this irreverent young man, having succeeded in
his efforts at diversion and fully satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t. I&#8217;m a decent human womanbody, that
knows when she&#8217;s sassed at an&#8217; when she isn&#8217;t. And
you needn&#8217;t think you&#8217;re the only creatur&#8217; livin&#8217; can look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
after Gabriella Trent and them that&#8217;s dear to her. But&mdash;you
can&#8217;t help bein&#8217; what you are&mdash;<i>a man</i>!&#8221; The
infinite scorn which Mrs. Benton threw into that one
word tickled the ex-reporter into another gale of laughter,
during which the carriage arrived at the hotel entrance
and the group of Sobrante &#8220;boys&#8221; waiting there.</p>

<p>The sound of it didn&#8217;t please them. Not in the least.
Their own countenances wore an expression befitting a
funeral, and the mirth depicted on Ninian Sharp&#8217;s declared
him what they had often felt him to be&mdash;a stranger
and alien at Sobrante. It wasn&#8217;t his &#8220;little Captain&#8221;
that had gone and left them desolate. It was their own,
idolized &#8220;Lady Jess&#8221; in whom he had no right nor
parcel, even though he had so fully won her love and
confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I&#8217;ve my opinion of a man that can laugh&mdash;to-day&mdash;after
losing Sunny Face!&#8221; growled Samson under
his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light weight! Light weight, in his head. I always
said so,&#8221; added John Benton, solemn as an owl or&mdash;as
when he was attempting to lead the Sunday music
at Sobrante.</p>

<p>In one glance at their stern faces Ninian Sharp comprehended
what was in their minds, and set himself to
undo any false impression he had given. That, despite
their growls, they liked him he was perfectly sure; also,
that though they did indeed sorely feel the loss of the
girl they adored they were still human enough to enjoy
their present outing in the &#8220;City of the Angels,&#8221; and&mdash;a
good dinner!</p>

<p>Handing the ladies over to the care of an obsequious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
clerk, he proceeded to line up the ranchmen and to
usher them into the big dining-room, with its long array
of neatly-spread tables, and toward that corner of it
which the head waiter indicated.</p>

<p>Inwardly he enjoyed that brief march from the door
to the chairs, each &#8220;boy&#8221; assuming an air of I-do-this-sort-of-thing-every-day,
don&#8217;t-you-know, and each displaying
an awkwardness quite unknown at quiet
Sobrante. However, once in their places, and he acting
as interpreter of the menu spread before them, they forgot
themselves and awaited the feast with scant thought
for anything beyond it.</p>

<p>Till, just as Mr. Sharp was rising to rejoin Mrs.
Trent and Aunt Sally in another room, he bethought
himself to &#8220;count noses&#8221; and found himself one nose
short. One empty chair faced him, one fine old presence
was missing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, here! Where&#8217;s &#8216;Forty-niner?&#8217; Didn&#8217;t he
come with you from the station?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ranchmen stared at him and at each other; then
said John Benton, gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember now, he didn&#8217;t. Plaguyest proud old
chap ever handled a shotgun. Wouldn&#8217;t be beholden
to anybody for even one dinner. Well! He&#8217;s had experience
of Los Angeles an&#8217; ought to know his bearings.
Might ha&#8217; stepped round to that hospital he&#8217;s forever
talking about, or to that old crony tavern-keeper&#8217;s o&#8217;
his&#8217;n. But he&#8217;ll turn up before train starts for Marion
and home. Couldn&#8217;t keep him off Sobrante ranch though
you set the dogs on him. Thinks none of us, that&#8217;s a
mite younger&#8217;n him, has got sense enough to run things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
without his everlasting poke-nose thrust in. Lady Jess,
she was pleased to tell him she&#8217;d made him &#8216;Superintendent&#8217;
of the whole shooting-match an&#8217; that was one
time our &#8216;Captain&#8217; made a little mistake. But he&#8217;s
sort of touchy like and if he gets too top-lofty we can
easy set him down a peg. I&#8217;d like some butter, waiter;
and I&#8217;d like enough to <i>see</i>, this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, the carpenter cast a casual glance around,
as if to convey to all spectators the fact that he was
perfectly familiar with hotel tables and the manner of
dining thereat. The glance included the young mine
manager, but this time that gentleman&#8217;s sense of humor
was not touched. A vague uneasiness stirred within him,
and it was his ardent hope that when the home-returning
party took the train for Marion the old sharpshooter
would rejoin them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Trent will be grieved if he forsakes Sobrante
now that Jessica is gone. The old man <i>is</i> &#8216;touchy,&#8217; as
the boys say; and he has never quite forgiven his old
mates for that temporary doubt of his honesty. The
&#8216;house&#8217; will be lonely, indeed, if neither he nor the
little &#8216;Captain&#8217; goes in and out of it. Yes, I hope he&#8217;ll
be on hand; and till that time I&#8217;ll not mention him to
the lady of the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, when&mdash;dinner past and business transacted&mdash;the
Sobrante household gathered at the station, <i>en route</i>
for home, old Ephraim Marsh was still absent from his
rightful place; and to Mrs. Trent&#8217;s anxious exclamation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; hasn&#8217;t come yet! We can&#8217;t possibly
go and leave him behind! Does anybody know
where he is?&#8221; there was no reply save the warning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
whistle of the locomotive and the conductor&#8217;s hoarse command:
&#8220;All aboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Till Aunt Sally fancied a solution, crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;My suz! I believe he&#8217;s gone an&#8217; broke another
leg!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<small>IN THE TOURIST CAR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a time after the train pulled out from the station
at Los Angeles, Jessica Trent saw nothing for the mist
of tears which blurred her eyes; save that framed in
that mist was the sad, beautiful face of her mother. How
pale it had been! Yet how quiet the dear voice bidding
her &#8220;be worthy&#8221; of that dead father, whose representative
she must be. For his sake she was to be
educated. For his sake, to carry out his high ideals, she
had had to leave her home and &#8220;learn life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was it, more than books, my mother said.
&#8216;Life.&#8217; As if there were not the best sort of life at dear
Sobrante!&#8221; she murmured, fancying the loud &#8220;chug-chug&#8221;
of the train would cover her voice.</p>

<p>To her surprise it had not. For Mr. Hale answered as
if she had spoken aloud to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you begin to learn it right now and here,
my little maid. There are dozens of people in this car
and each one is very much alive. See that odd old lady in
the second section beyond ours. She seems to be in
trouble of some sort and is quite alone. She&#8217;s bobbed
under her seat a half-dozen times already, yet comes up
empty-handed every time. You might ask her if you can
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Mr. Hale was wise enough to know that the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and surest way of curing one&#8217;s own discontent is by relieving
that of somebody else.</p>

<p>For once Jessica was not inspired by the idea of
helping somebody. She was far more inclined to sit
still in her comfortable place and think about things it
were better she should forget&mdash;just for a little time.
Sobrante, little Ned and Luis, Buster her beloved mount,
the glorious garden behind the &#8220;house&#8221;&mdash;Oh! to think
each mile she journeyed, each turn of those ceaseless
wheels, carried her further and further away!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear! I&#8217;m really afraid the poor old soul will
hurt herself and she&#8217;s rung for the porter times without
end, yet he doesn&#8217;t come. Will you, or shall I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Hale had already half-risen and only delayed
to offer his services because he knew it better for
Jessica to be roused from her brooding. Fortunately,
her good breeding conquered her reluctance and, a
moment later, guiding herself along the aisle of the
swaying car, she reached the old lady&#8217;s side and
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, madam, but have you lost something?
Can I help you look for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The traveler rose so suddenly from her stooping posture
that her stiff, old-fashioned bonnet slipped to the back
of her neck and imparted a wild, rakish effect to her peculiar
attire. The bonnet was so big and deep, of that
shape known as &#8220;poke,&#8221; and the face it framed was so
wizened and small that Jessica could think of nothing
but some fairy-tale witch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but Sissy, me dear! Sure &#8217;tis the kind child
you are! Arrah musha! But I&#8217;ve lost me fine new gum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
shoes, what Barney, me son, gave me this very day whatever.
&#8216;With your rubbers and umberell, mother,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;sure you&#8217;ll be makin&#8217; the trip in fine style, and be
all forehanded again&#8217; the bad sort of weather you&#8217;ll be
meetin&#8217; th&#8217; other side this big counthry,&#8217; says he. And
now I&#8217;ve lost them entire, and the umberell&mdash;Here &#8217;tis.
Now ain&#8217;t that a fine one, Sissy dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I guess so. I don&#8217;t know much about
umbrellas we need them so seldom in California. But
the rubbers&mdash;I&#8217;ll look under the seat. I can, easier than
you. I&#8217;m young&mdash;smaller, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so much smaller, me dear, though younger by
some fifty-odd year I&#8217;ve no doubt. Bless your bonny
face! Found them ye have. Thank you, me child, and
wait&mdash;here&#8217;s a reward for your goodness, be sure. Sit
by till you eat it. &#8217;Twould do me old heart good, so
being it aches like a grumblin&#8217; tooth the now. Leavin&#8217;
Barney and the nice wife and the bairns, as I have.
Crossin&#8217; this big counthry all by my lone; and after that
the ocean; an&#8217; all that long way just to look upon old
Ireland once more and them in it I hold so dear. Barney&#8217;s
but one; in Ireland are three. One is a nun and
cannot; one is a priest and will not; and one is a wife
and must not come over to me in this purty land of
Ameriky. Was ever in old Ireland, me dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously Jessica had obeyed the old lady&#8217;s
invitation to share the wide seat with herself and had
smilingly accepted the half of a mint drop which her new
acquaintance offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat it slow and it&#8217;ll last you a long time, me dear.
I always carry a few sweeties in my pocket for the childher;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
but mayhap &#8217;twould do no harm were you to have
the other bit, seein&#8217;s you was so good as to help an
old body.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, and with a smile that softened the rugged
old face, Barney&#8217;s mother carefully deposited the second
half of the mint on Jessica&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. It is very nice,&#8221; said the girl, smiling
herself at thought of Ned&#8217;s disgust in being offered but
one piece of candy, and that with such an air of generosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fair lookin&#8217; little maid, me dear, an&#8217; what
might your name be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessica Trent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your home, lassie? Where&#8217;s that at?&#8221; queried
this stranger with friendly curiosity. &#8220;And be you, too,
travelin&#8217; by your lone in these steam cars? Why for
and where to? Sure, if so be, and our roads lie together
a bit we might bear one another company. &#8217;Twould do
me old heart good to keep your bonny face alongside
till the pain of this partin&#8217; from Barney eases up a trifle.
A good lad, is he, and forehanded enough, Heaven prosper
him! Free with the gold to pay the toll of my
journey&mdash;Whisht, alanna! I&#8217;ve five hundred dollars
sewed in me petticoat! Mind that, Jessica Trent, and
mintion it to none!&#8221;</p>

<p>The last information was given in a sibilant whisper,
that might have been heard by other ears than Jessica&#8217;s,
and was to her so wonderful that she stared in astonishment.
This plainly-dressed old lady carrying so much
money? Who would have dreamed it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Me own name is Dalia Mary Moriarty. Me son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Barney, he come to Ameriky when but a tiny bairn, along
with Dennis me man. To Californy Dennis went, to a
place called Riverside, an&#8217; a gardener by trade went
into oranges an&#8217; olives. The blessin&#8217; of Heaven was on
him an&#8217; he prospered, even as Barney himself has done.
But &#8217;twas not till Dennis stepped into another world, the
world beyant this, me dear, that I left Connemara
an&#8217; follyed here. A nice town, &#8217;tis to be sure, but not
like Ireland. There&#8217;s no land that ever I see can match
old Ireland for richness an&#8217; greenness, me dear. Here
in Californy &#8217;tis all the talk of &#8216;irrigatin&#8217;,&#8217; &#8216;irrigatin&#8217;!&#8217;
Nought grows without that costly &#8216;irrigatin&#8217;,&#8217; but in me
own true land the water is given with the crops by the
same free Hand above. Sure, I&#8217;ll be glad to get me home
to a spot where I&#8217;ll be let toss out a dipper of water without
bein&#8217; bid: &#8216;Don&#8217;t waste it, mother! Remember the
garden!&#8217; As if I was ever let to forget it!&#8221; The old
lady paused for breath, then added: &#8220;But &#8217;tis kind they
was, each and ivery one. Now, all about your own self,
me dear, if so be there&#8217;s none waitin&#8217; you to leave me an&#8217;
tend them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica turned her head and saw that Mr. Hale had
settled himself for a nap, so replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hale has gone to sleep so he will not need me for
a time. He is the lawyer gentleman who is taking me
across the continent to my mother&#8217;s cousin in New York.
I am to live with her till I am educated enough to go
back to Sobrante ranch, my home. My father is dead.
My mother is the most beautiful gentlewoman in&mdash;in the
world, I guess. I have the dearest little brother Ned&mdash;Edward,
his real name is. Besides him, we have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
little adopted one, Luis Maria Manuel Alessandro Garcia,
and his father is dead too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saints save us! So will the bairn be soon if he has
to shoulder that great name! Sounds like some them
old Spaniard folkses that crop up, now an&#8217; again, round
Riverside way! But go on, me dear. &#8217;Tis most interestin&#8217;
to hear tell of your folks, and so be as that you&#8217;re
travelin&#8217; to that same city of Ne&#8217; York, where I take
ship for home, we&#8217;ll be pleasin&#8217; company for one another,
so we will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was not so sure of that. By the jolting of the
car the new gum shoes had again fallen to the floor and
disappeared beneath the seat; and again she was bidden,
rather peremptorily to:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seek them, child! seek them quick! If we should
come to one them meal-stations, an&#8217; they not in hand,
however could I leave the car?&#8221;</p>

<p>Overshoes were articles the little Californian had rarely
seen and never owned and, glancing out of window at
the sunny landscape, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what can you want of two pairs of shoes on
your feet at one time? Besides, it&#8217;s past the rainy
season and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, child! Would have me neglect the last gift of
me Barney son? Out of this car I steps not at all without
both me umberell an&#8217; me gum shoes. Meal-stations,
or whatever. Mind that! An&#8217; &#8217;tis them same what give
the only bit of exercise possible on these week-long
journeys, you know. &#8216;Get out at every stoppin&#8217; place,
mother, an&#8217; stretch your tired legs with a tramp up an&#8217;
down them station platforms,&#8217; says me boy, Barney.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>Jessica once more restored the overshoes and for
the comfort of both suggested that they be tied fast to
the old lady&#8217;s wrist by a string. Also, she began to feel
that a whole week of this companion&#8217;s society would be
hard to endure, despite the certain friendliness of Mrs.
Moriarty. Fortunately, just then, a whistle sounded and
the train began to slow up at a station. This roused
Mr. Hale to come forward and, with a courteous bow to
the old lady, bid Jessica:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, dear. We stop here long enough to take on
water; and I&#8217;ll show you some interesting things about
this great overland train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the novelty of her surroundings had banished,
for the time, the homesickness of Jessica&#8217;s heart. Everything
was &#8220;interesting&#8221; indeed; from the great water
tank with its canvas pipe for filling the engine-boiler,
to the crowded baggage cars. As the stop was for
several minutes, nearly everybody left the carriages, to
pace swiftly up and down for the relief of seat-weary
muscles, or to enter the small dining-room to snatch a
hasty lunch. The place was already packed with hungry
humanity and passing its window, Mr. Hale complacently
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Blessing on Aunt Sally and her fine cooking! As
soon as the train moves on again we&#8217;ll sample her basket.
The food will be good for a day or so but after that we,
too, will have to trust to meal-stations, except on those
stretches of the road where a dining-car is attached.
Now, let&#8217;s look at the great engine, and make acquaintance,
if we can, with the skillful engineer who holds
our lives in his hands. A moment&#8217;s carelessness on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
part means great danger to us, and his faithfulness is
worth far greater reward than it ever attains. Another
bit for your memory book: a single engine is run but a
comparatively short part of our long journey. Coming
to California, I learned that we had changed engines
just fourteen times. Those, yonder, are the tourist-cars;
less luxurious than the Pullman we travel in and cheaper.
For the benefit of the many who cannot afford first-class.
By the way, it would be a nice plan to enter the
last end of the train and make our way forward, from
car to car, till we reach our own seats in the &#8216;Arizona&#8217;&mdash;as
our sleeper is called.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they did; and Jessica thought she had never seen
anything so wonderful as this traveling disclosed. Especially
was she interested in the &#8220;tourist&#8221; carriages;
for until now she had associated that word with the
wealthy, rather impertinent persons who made southern
California a winter amusement ground and had none
too much respect for the rights of residents whose
ranches they visited. One such group, she well
remembered, had driven over Sobrante as if it had been
a public park, or with even greater freedom, since its
temporarily absent mistress returned to find her garden
despoiled of its floral treasures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tourist&#8221; now began to stand for other things, in
this young traveler&#8217;s mind. For weary mothers, cooking
scant messes for their fretful babies upon the great
stove in the corner of the car; for bare seats, sometimes
heaped with all sorts of household belongings;
for, indeed, a glimpse of that poverty to which the strict
economies of Sobrante seemed actual luxury.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;Why, how different it is from our place in the
&#8216;Arizona!&#8217; I never, never, saw so many children!
How they do cry! How hot and tired the mothers
look! Oh! can&#8217;t I do something for somebody?&#8221; cried
the girl, actually distressed by the discomfort about
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t interfere, dear. They might not like it.
Besides, it&#8217;s not so bad as this all the time. We&#8217;re only
beginning the long trip. After a little, things adjust
themselves. People become accustomed to their cramped
surroundings and acquainted with one another. By the
time we reach the other side the continent, here and in
our own car, we will seem like one big family&mdash;so
friendly we shall grow, and so many mutually interesting
things we shall find by the way;&#8221; said Mr. Hale. Then
added, rather suddenly: &#8220;Why, Jessica, child! What are
you doing now?&#8221;</p>

<p>What, indeed! This inspection of the train, begun
in simple curiosity, was having a startling ending. At
the extreme rear of the car they were in sat an old man,
fondling a shrieking infant and vainly endeavoring to
quiet it for the frail young mother who looked helplessly
on. Too weak and ill she was to do more than fix her
eyes upon the child and to rest her head against the
uncushioned back of the seat, while the gray-haired
man&mdash;Could he have been the baby&#8217;s grandfather? If
so he showed little skill at nursing, for the more he
petted and pitied the small creature, the more it wriggled
and yelled.</p>

<p>Just as there sounded from outside the conductor&#8217;s
order: &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; and the people came hurrying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
back into the car, Jessica forced her way among them
to where the old man sat and catching the baby from his
arms, cried in a very ecstasy of joy:</p>

<p>&#8220;O you blessed old &#8216;Forty-niner!&#8217; That isn&#8217;t the way
to hold a baby! see me!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE LONG JOURNEY ENDS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hale</span> never forgot that railway trip.</p>

<p>To rouse Jessica Trent from her sorrow at leaving
home he had suggested her helping others; and so thoroughly
did she follow his advice that he soon had a dozen
people depending upon him for counsel and comfort.
Quoth that young traveler, in the very presence of the
ailing mother of the tourist car:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so much better off in our &#8216;Arizona,&#8217; dear
Mr. Hale. Let&#8217;s take this poor little woman and this
precious baby right back there with us. She can have
my own soft seat with you and I can sit with Mrs.
Moriarty, as she wanted me to do. Dear Mr. Marsh&mdash;Well,
he must be with us in there, too. If he loved me
so well he would hide away from the others and come
all the way to the other ocean, just because he couldn&#8217;t
live without me, course, I can&#8217;t live without him. Why
he didn&#8217;t tell them was&mdash;was just because.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably a satisfactory reason to him and seems to
be to you, Miss Jessica. Yet what&#8217;s to become of him in
New York? Don&#8217;t for a moment imagine your future
hostess, Mrs. Dalrymple, will have him at her house.
From all I&#8217;ve heard of her she&#8217;s a woman of strong
opinions and one of them is that it will be better for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
you to cut loose from your western companions for a
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica regarded him with some surprise, but her confidence
was not shaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you see, she doesn&#8217;t know &#8216;Forty-niner.&#8217; I
suppose she&#8217;s read stories about cowboys and such
things; and my father used to say that the stories were
mostly exag&mdash;exaggerated, and written by people who&#8217;d
never been west in their lives. Fancy! Writing a book
about men one never saw! Anyway, Cousin Margaret
is sure to like Ephraim Marsh. Nobody could help
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sharpshooter had settled himself most
comfortably in the &#8216;Arizona,&#8217; occupying any seat which
happened to be vacant for the moment and quietly retiring
to his rightful berth in the &#8220;tourist car&#8221; when
bedtime came. The ailing mother had accepted Jessica&#8217;s
place and berth in Mr. Hale&#8217;s section, and the
little girl herself had joined forces with Mrs. Moriarty.</p>

<p>Jessica had had a reasonable sum of money given her,
when she left Sobrante, her mother believing it would
add to that womanly training she needed to have charge
of it; and without consulting her present guardian the
girl had given the sick woman enough of her fund to
pay the different rate of fare.</p>

<p>It was too late for Mr. Hale to object, and he was too
polite to do so. The utmost he could accomplish was
to warn his charge to expend nothing more without his
advice, and to pass as much of his time in the smoker
as was possible. Fortunately, the baby was a happy
child, when physically comfortable; and it was a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sleeper; so that the lawyer&#8217;s fear of being kept awake
at night, by having it in the lower berth, proved groundless.</p>

<p>By the end of the second day out Jessica and the
baby, which she carried everywhere, had become the life
of the train; &#8220;going visiting&#8221; in one car after another,
making friends in each, and feeling almost as if they
were always to journey thus amid these now familiar
faces. But all journeys end in time, and as they drew
nearer and nearer to the eastern coast, one after another
these fellow travelers departed at some stopping-place,
nearest their homes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it seems as if there was nothing in this world
but just to say &#8216;Good-by!&#8217;&#8221; cried Jessica, tearfully,
when the hour came for baby and its mother to leave the
&#8220;Arizona.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, dearie, you&#8217;ve made it a pleasant trip
for me, and it&#8217;s a little world. We may meet again;
but if we don&#8217;t, just you keep on shedding sunshine and
you&#8217;ll never be sad for long,&#8221; said the invalid, herself
grieved to part with the little Californian yet grateful
to have reached her own home alive.</p>

<p>Then almost before she knew it, the week-long trip
had ended. The train steamed into the great station in
Jersey City, those who had come &#8220;all the way across&#8221;
gathered their belongings, submitted to be brushed and
freshened from the stains of the long trip, hurriedly bade
one another good-by and were gone. Even Mrs. Moriarty
had time for but a single hug and the bestowal of
a whole mint drop ere she was captured by a red-faced
Irishwoman in a redder bonnet, who called her &#8220;Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Dalia,&#8221; and bore her away through the crowd toward
that waiting steamer which should carry her onward to
her beloved Ireland.</p>

<p>Jessica watched her go and caught her breath with a
sob. It sent a sharp pain through her heart to find that
she seemed the only one for whom a joyful welcome was
not waiting; and she almost resented Mr. Hale&#8217;s blithe
voice and manner as he laid his hand on her shoulder
and demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Tears in your eyes, little maid? Are you
so sorry to have done with those tiresome cars and to
be on solid ground again? My! But it&#8217;s raining a deluge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Raining? Why&mdash;how can it now, so late, in the very
middle of April! But isn&#8217;t it good Grandma Moriarty
did have the gum shoes, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Good enough for her, but how about ourselves,
eh? As for &#8216;raining in April,&#8217; that&#8217;s just the
orthodox state of the weather here in the east. Never
mind. A carriage will take us safely enough to your
cousin&#8217;s house. This way, please. Have you your
satchel? Porter, take it and these. Now come. I&#8217;m as
glad as a schoolboy to be at home again&mdash;or so near it
that the first suburban train will carry me to it. Six
months since I saw my wife and daughters! That&#8217;s a
big slice out of a man&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so glad, indeed, that his usual thoughtfulness
for others gave place to personal considerations; and he
forgot that to his young companion this was not a
joyful return but a dreaded beginning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>&#8220;This way, Jessica! Step in, please, out of the
wet!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl obeyed and entered the carriage, and though
she had checked her tears she felt she had never seen
anything so dismal as that great wharf, with its dripping
vehicles, nor heard anything so dreadful as the cries of
the angry drivers, jostling each other in the storm.</p>

<p>Then they drove on to the ferry-boat and there a thunder
shower burst upon that region such as had not been
known there for many a day. To the little Californian,
fresh from that thunderless Paraiso d&#8217;Oro, it seemed as
if the end of the world might be at hand; and she cowered
against Mr. Hale who slipped his arm caressingly
about her. At last he had begun to understand something
of her loneliness and blamed himself that he had
not done so earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little girl, does this frighten you? To me it
is delightful. At present so fierce, this electric storm
will clear the air of all impurity, and by the time we
reach Washington Square, where Mrs. Dalrymple lives,
we shall have almost Californian sunshine. Just think!
Though you have never seen her she is your very own
&#8216;blood relation.&#8217; She knew your mother when she, too,
was a little maid like yourself. I confess I should have
liked to know that lady then myself. She must have been
a model of all girlish sweetness, as she is now of womanly
graces. To grow up such a gentlewoman as
Mrs. Trent&mdash;that&#8217;s why you are breasting a thunder-storm
here in New York to-day. Hark! That peal wasn&#8217;t quite
so loud as the others. The storm is rapidly passing
eastward and the clouds are lightening. Now look out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
of the window and get your first glimpse of our biggest
American city. Not the finest part, by any means, but
every part is interesting to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus advised Jessica peered through the rain-splashed
glass into that crowded west-side avenue, where it
seemed as if the never-ending line of drays and wagons,
the clanging street-cars, the roar of the &#8220;elevated&#8221;
trains above, and the shouts and screams of all the teamsters,
was pandemonium indeed. She did not find the
outlook at all &#8220;interesting,&#8221; as the loyal citizen had
described it, but most confusing and terrifying. If
this were New York, however should she be able to
endure it?</p>

<p>With a down sinking of her heart, and a homesickness
quite too deep for tears, the &#8220;little Captain&#8221; leaned
back and closed her eyes, while her fancy pictured that
far-away Sobrante, lying bathed in sunshine and in a
peacefulness so wholly in contrast to this dreadful city.
Memories of her home recalled the fact that Ephraim,
a part of her old world, was not with her now and that
in the confusion of leaving the train she had quite forgotten
him. This sent her upright again, startled and
eager, to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Hale! How terrible! We&#8217;ve <i>forgotten</i>
&#8216;Forty-niner!&#8217; we must go right back and get him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible. He should have been on the lookout for
us and kept us in sight. Besides, if we did go back we
couldn&#8217;t find him. New York crowds are always changing
and he&#8217;d move on with the rest. Doubtless, he
thinks it easy to overtake us anywhere here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was hurt. She could not realize how greatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
tried the lawyer had been by many of her thoughtless
actions during their long journey, nor how impatient
he was now to be free from his care of her and away
to his own household. His irritation was perfectly natural,
and, secretly, he was extremely glad that they
had thus easily lost the sharpshooter. It was a most
satisfactory way out of the difficulty in appearing at
Mrs. Dalrymple&#8217;s house with the veteran ranchman in
train. That she would decline to receive Mr. Marsh,
he was quite sure; in which case he would himself have
been left with the old fellow upon his hands, to care
for in some way till he could be expressed back to
Sobrante. Yes, he was certainly relieved; but he did not
enjoy the reproachful glance which his young charge
bestowed upon him as he spoke. After a moment she
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will carriages take you anywhere you want to go,
here in this big place? Can you hire one for money,
just as in our dear Los Angeles, when Mr. Ninian got
one to take us from one station to the other? Could a
little girl hire one, herself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course; but Jessica, dear child, get no silly
notions into your head of running about this city
alone&mdash;even in a public hack. Within a very few moments I
shall hand you over to the care of your future guardian
and you will have to be guided by her in everything.
Nor need you worry about Ephraim. He&#8217;s an old campaigner,
has a tongue to ask questions with, and this
is a decent community. He&#8217;ll look out for himself well
enough. There! A half-dozen more blocks and we shall
have arrived!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>Jessica could not answer. She turned her head aside
and carefully studied the street through which they were
passing. It looked hopelessly like others they had left.
The houses bordering it were so tall and close together
that they seemed to take up all the air, leaving none for
her to breathe. It was a great relief when they came to
an open square and stopped before a big house fronting
upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I fancied this was the place! One of our old
landmarks&mdash;and very few are left. How fine for you to
come to live here, child! I almost envy you the distinction,&#8221;
cried the New Yorker, with enthusiasm, as he
stepped from the carriage and turned to help Jessica out.</p>

<p>But she was already on the pavement, staring eagerly
at her new home and seeing nothing so remarkable as
Mr. Hale fancied about it. It was some larger than the
other houses near, almost twice as wide, indeed; and it
stood somewhat back from the street, guarded by a
sharp-pointed iron fence and an imposing gate. Two
rather rusty iron lions couched before the entrance, on
the brown stone steps, but time had softened their once
fierce expression to a sort of grin which could frighten
nobody&mdash;not even a stranger from Paraiso d&#8217;Oro. On
both sides of the mansion was a stretch of green grass, a
rare feature in a city where every foot of ground was so
precious, and that spoke much for the obstinacy of its
possessor who must repeatedly have refused to part with
it for building purposes.</p>

<p>So absorbed in looking at the mansion were both the
lawyer and Jessica that they scarcely heard the murmur
of voices behind them, where their jehu was quietly discussing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and arranging a little matter of business with a
man who had ridden beside himself on his coachman&#8217;s
seat; nor, till they passed through the iron gateway and
ascended the steps, did they realize that the man, also,
had followed.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hale turned his head and uttered a cry of
regret. But Jessica, likewise turning, felt nothing but
joy as she flung herself upon Ephraim Marsh, standing
&#8220;at attention,&#8221; as composed and at ease as if he were
waiting his mistress&#8217;s commands upon the porch at
Sobrante.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Marsh! <i>you</i>&mdash;here?&#8221; cried the lawyer.
&#8220;We&mdash;Miss Jessica feared she had lost you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t have. She couldn&#8217;t. She&#8217;ll never lose
me till the grave covers me,&#8221; answered the sharpshooter,
solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Ephy! don&#8217;t speak of graves, right here at the
beginning of things! And oh! how glad I am to have you,
how glad, how glad! You&#8217;re a real bit of dear Sobrante
and give me courage!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great key turned in the door-lock, a bolt or two
shot back and the door swung on its mighty hinges;
slowly and cautiously at first, then with more confidence
as the attendant saw nothing formidable in these visitors.
They seemed to be a gentleman, a soldier, and a
little girl, where he had anticipated beggars or burglars,
or worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Dalrymple at home? This is Miss Jessica
Trent, of California, whom the lady expects; and I am&mdash;this
is my card. Mr. Marsh, also, of California&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>Mr. Hale paused then motioning Jessica forward followed
whither the old butler led the way; &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
bringing up the rear with his stiffest military stride and
most impassive expression.</p>

<p>They were ushered into a great room at the back of
the house. Its long windows were opened upon an iron
balcony, from which a flight of steps ran down into what
once had been a charming garden but was now a neglected
wilderness. The room itself was oppressive from
its crowding furniture, dust-covered and dark in tone,
and a faded carpet strewn with much litter added to the
unpleasant effect. Till suddenly Jessica discovered that
the carpet had once been a &#8220;picture.&#8221; An old-time hunting
scene with horses and people and dogs galore; where
some of the horses had lost their heads, the dogs their
tails, and the red coats of the huntsmen had suffered
much-through the tread of feet during years and years
of time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was down upon her knees examining
it, calling attention to this detail or that, till the silence
in which they had been left was broken by the sound of
a tap-tap along the hall and the old butler reappeared,
announcing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam Dalrymple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale rose and advanced, &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; made his
best &#8220;salute,&#8221; but Jessica neither moved nor spoke. She
could only gaze with fascination at the figure standing
between the portieres and wait what next. That an
&#8220;old lady&#8221;? <i>That!</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>IN THE ANCIENT MANSION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;My</span> cousin Jessica! I bid you welcome. Studying
my wonderful old carpet, I see. Your mother did that
before you, child, and many another Waldron besides her.
Mr. Hale, I am happy to meet you. Be seated, please.
This other gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim Marsh, at your sarvice, Ma&#8217;am. I belong
to Miss Trent. I&#8217;m from Sobrante with her, Ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale waited with much interest for what might
follow this statement, but was unprepared for the gracious
suavity of Madam Dalrymple, of whose temper he
had heard much. With a kindly, if patronizing, smile
she waved Ephraim aside, directing her own old servitor
to:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take Marsh below, Tipkins, and see that he has refreshments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently, the Madam had accepted the sharpshooter
as a correct feature of the situation, considering that it
was the mark of a gentlewoman to be well attended; and
as the two old men left the room he wondered how
&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; himself would relish being classed with
the servants &#8220;below stairs.&#8221; However, Ephraim cared
not one whit for that. He had attained his ambition.
He had come east to share in educating his &#8220;little Captain&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and he was now assigned to a home in the same
house with her. &#8220;Hooray!&#8221; was his thought; and,
further, that as soon as one other small matter was settled
he would sit him down and write a letter to the other
&#8220;boys&#8221; that would make them stare.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Dalrymple sank gracefully into a
deep chair, displaying no sign of the intense pain each
movement cost her and physically unable to stand for a
moment longer. Thence she held out a thin white hand
toward the girl who had not yet risen from the floor, nor
left off staring at the lady before her&mdash;so wholly different
from the picture she had formed of the &#8220;stern old
woman&#8221; with whom she was to live.</p>

<p>Now blushing at her own rudeness, which she was sure
the other had observed, she rose and came slowly forward
and took the extended hand. Poor hand! So white, yet
with such cruelly gnarled and swollen joints! There
was no kiss proffered from either side; even impulsive
Jessica feeling that she would no more dare touch that
person in the arm-chair than she would a bit of the most
delicate, and forbidden, porcelain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for welcoming me, Cousin Margaret; if
I am to call you that?&#8221; said &#8220;Lady Jess,&#8221; all the wonder
and admiration she felt showing in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my dear. We are second-cousins twice
removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Cousin Margaret, my mother sends you her
dear love and great respect; and I am to obey you in all
things&mdash;all things that I can; and I am to do for you
whatever you will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, having ended her little speech as duly instructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
by her mother, Jessica folded her arms across
her bosom and tossed back her yellow curls, in a characteristic
gesture, now wholly familiar to Mr. Hale, but
which to a stranger had a little air of defiance. So Mrs.
Dalrymple interpreted it, and with some amusement
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You make some reservation of your obedience, then,
do you, Cousin Jessica? Like Gabriella herself. Meaning,
maybe, to obey me when and only when it suits
your mood to do so. Very well; we shall understand
each other perfectly; and those who understand know
how to avoid collision. Be assured, we shall never quarrel,
little cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was troubled. She felt she had expressed herself
badly and offended this wonderful lady whom she
longed to have love her, and who seemed so little inclined
to do so. She hastened to explain:</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant only if you should happen to tell me to do
something that I felt wasn&#8217;t right&mdash;or that is different
from what my mother likes&mdash;or, oh! dear! Please <i>do</i>
understand what I want to say, for, truly, it was nothing
naughty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Madam Dalrymple laughed, and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your words, little cousin, are but another instance
of the fact that explanations are the most hopeless things
in this world. When Gabriella left me she, too, tried to
&#8216;explain&#8217; and failed to make a bit of change in the bare
truth. She left me because she wished. You&#8217;ll disobey
me, if you do, because you wish. That&#8217;s the matter in a
nutshell. One thing I&#8217;ll make clear at the beginning:
I shall lay no unnecessary commands upon you, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
shall insist that you remember everywhere and always
that you are a&mdash;<i>Waldron</i>. You belong to a race that
has high ideals and lives up to them. Ah! yes! One
other thing. I don&#8217;t care for demonstrations of affection.
We have not come together because we are, or
ever will be, fond of one another; but because we are
both Waldrons and the time is fitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! must you leave us, Mr. Hale? Beg pardon for
not&mdash;not having attended more to you than to the child
there; and thank you for your safe escort of her. I shall
write my cousin Gabriella at once and inform her that
Jessica has arrived. Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale bowed himself out, feeling almost as if he
were deserting his traveling companion to a most unhappy
fate. For a girl like &#8220;Lady Jess&#8221; to be housed
with Madam Dalrymple seemed a bitter thing. The
child had lived in the sunshine, materially and spiritually,
and the gloom of that old mansion in Washington Square
had been oppressive even to him and during such a brief
stay. And for the first time since he had discovered
&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; a runaway on the train he was thankful
for his presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a trio of stubborn wills shut up in that dark
house, this minute, for even Miss Jessie has a will of her
own; as for those of the Madam and Ephraim, should
they happen to clash, I wonder which would conquer!
However, I&#8217;ve done with them, for the present, and now
for home and my own dear girls!&#8221; thought the lawyer,
as he reentered the waiting carriage and was driven
toward the station which led to his own home, a few miles
north of town.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>Madam Dalrymple made a slight motion to rise and
dropped the slender cane which had rested against her
chair, and the &#8220;tap-tapping&#8221; of which had announced
her coming through the hall. Instantly, Jessica had
picked it up and restored it, and was as promptly thanked.
Moreover the lady&#8217;s eyes, still marvelously dark and
bright for one so old, rested with an interested expression
on the young face before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was well thought, Cousin Jessica. Your
mother must have trained you better than I feared, living
so in the wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it isn&#8217;t a wilderness, not in the least. It is the
most beautiful spot in all the world! New York can&#8217;t
compare with our lovely Sobrante&mdash;not compare! And
I hope she didn&#8217;t have to &#8216;train&#8217; me to do a thing like
that, which nobody could help doing, could they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Came naturally, eh? Better still. Sit down. It
tires me to see you standing. Luncheon will be served
at one and it is almost that time now. Sit down and
tell me about your journey&mdash;or anything you choose.
Only speak low. I observe that by nature, if you are
not excited, your voice is fairly good. Gentlewomen
are never noisy nor obtrusive. Remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica would rather have remained standing, or, better
still, have stepped through the long open window out
into that rain-drenched old garden, a-glitter now in the
sunshine that was almost as bright as Sobrante&#8217;s. But
she reflected that here was her first chance to &#8220;obey&#8221;
and placed herself on a low stool near her hostess, fixing
her gaze upon the lady&#8217;s face with a curiosity that failed
to offend, it was so full of admiration. Yet finding that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
serene scrutiny somewhat trying, Mrs. Dalrymple herself
opened the conversation by asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Gabriella, your mother, keep her good looks?
Or is she faded from that rude life she leads and the
sorrow she has met?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faded? My&mdash;mother&mdash;faded? Why, how queer!
Cousin Margaret Dalrymple, she is almost the most
beautiful woman in all southern California. Truly! Mr.
Ninian says so, and Mr. Hale did, and&mdash;and I think so!
She is just like the Madonna picture in Fra Sebastian&#8217;s
house, she is so lovely. Her hair&mdash;her hair isn&#8217;t quite as
white as yours, it is a beautiful dark gold color&mdash;but she
has almost as much as you. She doesn&#8217;t wear it in that
puffed up, frizzly kind of way, but just turns it back in
one big coil that is&mdash;is lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple slightly winced. She did wear a profusion
of snow-white locks, as became a venerable
woman of fashion, and Jessica was not wise enough, as
yet, to know that such headgear may be bought in a shop
and put on or off at will. The next question followed
rather soon and sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she still sing? She once had a charming voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it is like the birds in the trees along the arroyo
to hear my mother sing! She doesn&#8217;t often now, it
makes her think so much of my father. Why, all the
&#8216;boys&#8217; say that it was something wonderful when they
two sang together of a Sunday morning, or sometimes
at night. John Benton said it was as near like the
music of Heaven as anything on the earth could be.
John is very religious, John is; only, sometimes, when
Aunt Sally tries his patience very much he says&mdash;he says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
things that don&#8217;t sound nice. But Samson is religiouser
even than John. They&#8217;re both of them just perfectly
splendid &#8216;boys.&#8217; Oh! all our &#8216;boys&#8217; are fine, just fine!
You&#8217;d love them every one!&#8221; answered Jessica with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I was never any too fond of &#8216;boys,&#8217; and
Gabriella must be crazy to try and run a ranch by the aid
of a few &#8216;boys.&#8217; Why doesn&#8217;t she employ men, if so be
she will persist in living in such an outlandish place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Captain&#8221; smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose they&#8217;re not exactly real boys, like
Ned or Luis. They&#8217;re quite grown up and gray-headed,
most of them. They all worked for my father, who
found them scattered about the world, sort of &#8216;down on
their luck,&#8217; as Marty says, and brought them all to dear
Sobrante to give them a home and &#8216;another chance.&#8217;
They just about worshipped my father, I guess, and I
know they do my darling mother. Oh! I wish you could
see her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wholly her own fault that I cannot. Here comes
Tipkins to announce luncheon, and I have quite forgotten
that you should have been taken to your room to
freshen yourself after your journey. Odd! that Gabriella
should have sent a man and not a maid with you. But I
suppose she knew I would prefer one of my own selection,
here in the east.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! She didn&#8217;t <i>send</i> Ephraim. He&mdash;he just came
because he loved me so and wouldn&#8217;t stay behind. He&mdash; Why
dear old &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; actually ran away! Fancy!
Just as the <i>little</i> boys so love to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! A strange life, a strange bringing up you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
seem to have had. Tipkins, send Barnes to attend Miss
Jessica.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madam, I&#8217;ll&mdash;try,&#8221; replied the old servant,
bowing and withdrawing upon the errand. Both he and
his mistress well knew that Barnes, my lady&#8217;s-maid, was
rarely &#8220;sent&#8221; upon any errand her own will did not
dictate, and that she had more than once declared, since
the coming of Jessica had been decided upon, that &#8220;the
Madam needn&#8217;t go for to expect me to &#8217;tend upon no
brats at my time of life, nor she needn&#8217;t ask it. If she
does I&#8217;ll give notice and that&#8217;ll settle <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, curiosity often accomplishes what authority
cannot; and because Tipkins had reported below stairs
that &#8220;our Miss Gabriella&#8217;s little daughter looks like a
hangel out of Heaven,&#8221; and the sharpshooter had treated
her maidship with such profound reverence, upon being
presented as &#8220;Miss Jessica&#8217;s man&#8221;&mdash;the arbitrary Barnes
condescended to obey the present summons.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple had made a slight effort to rise from
her chair and Jessica had already sprung forward to
help her, when the white-capped and white-haired maid
appeared; but the lady now sank back again, directing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Miss Jessica to her room, Barnes, please, and
help her to make what slight change is necessary now.
Her luggage can be unpacked before dinner. I will
wait here for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luncheon is served, Madam,&#8221; remonstrated the maid,
rather sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can be put back. I will wait for you here,&#8221; returned
the mistress with equal sharpness.</p>

<p>With a sniff and a bridling of her head Barnes departed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
bidding Jessica: &#8220;This way, please, and mind the
stairs. All this twaddle about old things being better&#8217;n
new and risking mortals&#8217; legs on rags, beats me. Hmm.
Some folks grow queerer as they grow older, some does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica followed in wondering silence and, although
warned to &#8220;mind the stairs,&#8221; caught her toe in the frayed
covering of one and fell. But she was up again as soon
as down and without quite understanding why was indignant
with her guide for the slighting tone in which she
spoke. Certainly, the carpet had once been a very fine
one. Even now, where an unbroken spot appeared, the
foot sank deep into a mossy greenness that was delightful,
and fully bore out the vivid description of this old
home which her mother had sometimes given her.</p>

<p>But even in Mrs. Trent&#8217;s own girlhood days the furnishings
of this ancient mansion had become worn almost
to uselessness, and the years which had elapsed
since then had finished the work of destruction. In truth,
all the floor coverings were now but what Barnes called
&#8220;man traps,&#8221; where unwary feet would be caught and
falls result.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas one of them same holes the Madam caught
her own high heel in and got an injury was the beginning
of her lameness. The doctor calls it &#8216;gout,&#8217; he does; but
I, well, I calls it &#8216;pride,&#8217; just plain, senseless, family
pride. Whatever <i>was</i>, my lady thinks, is far and away
better nor what <i>is</i>. But as for me and the rest of the servants,
give us even the cheapest sort of &#8216;ingrain,&#8217; providing
it was new and we&#8217;d feel safer for our old bones.
Well, here is your room, Miss, and if you&#8217;ll let me slip
off your frock I&#8217;ll soon make you tidy.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Thence she held out a thin white hand toward the girl who had not yet risen<br />
from the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap">(See page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>)</span></p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>Had Jessica known it this was a fine concession on the
part of ever-weary Barnes, who acknowledged to her
advancing age with a frankness which her mistress denied,
but she looked so tired from her climb up the long
stairs that the girl promptly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Don&#8217;t you trouble, please, Mrs. Barnes. I can
wait upon myself quite well. Indeed, I never have anybody
to wait upon me, except now and then my darling
mother&mdash;just for love&#8217;s sake.&#8221; Then with a swift recollection
of the tenderness those motherly fingers had
shown, even in the matter of buttoning or unbuttoning a
frock, her blue eyes grew moist and for a moment that
dreadful homesickness made her turn half-faint.</p>

<p>Now old Barnes was neither dense nor unkind. She
was merely spoiled. She had domineered over her fractious
mistress since both of them were young and she
really felt that she was of more authority in the house
than its owner. She and Tipkins had entered service together,
at the time of Mrs. Dalrymple&#8217;s early marriage,
and like the storied &#8220;brook&#8221; they &#8220;had gone on forever.&#8221;
Dozens, maybe hundreds, of other servants had
&#8220;flowed&#8221; through the mansion and few had tarried long.
None save these two original servitors willingly put up
with the peculiarities of the Madam, and the old-time
inconveniences of the establishment. She was quick to
notice the down dropping of the girlish face and the
gleam of tears beneath the long lashes, and said, consolingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Miss, it&#8217;ll seem lonesome like and different
at first. But you&#8217;ll get used to it, you know. A body
can get used to anything in time. I suppose Californy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
a terrible hot place, now ain&#8217;t it? So it&#8217;s a good job
you&#8217;ve come away from it before the summer. That old
man of yours, he&#8217;s a queer stick, I judge. But polite,
why he&#8217;s real polite. And old. That&#8217;s a fine thing,
too. If he&#8217;d been young, Madam would have sent him
about his business so fast &#8217;twould have made him dizzy.
But she likes everything old. Having old folks about
her makes her forget her own age and fancy herself still
a mere girl. Never remind my lady that she&#8217;s not as
young as she used to be and you&#8217;ll get on&mdash;get on, fairly
well, that is. Now, ready? Is that the kind of frock
you generally wear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes had comfortably rested in a rocker while Jessica
washed and brushed at the great washstand, furnished
with such expensive and badly nicked china, in
one corner of the great chamber. The rocker had been
overlooked, in the preparation of this room for a young
girl&#8217;s use, and would have been removed had Madam
remembered it. She herself disdained the use of such a
chair and considered it totally unfit for well-bred people.
Easy chairs of ancient and ample proportions&mdash;these
were quite different; but until of late, since that accident
which Barnes had mentioned, she had herself never
occupied aught but the straight-backed ones, such as had
been the correct thing in her childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, most of my clothes are made like this. My
mother does them. Isn&#8217;t it pretty? I&#8217;ve two more;&#8221;
finished Jessica proudly, sweeping out the rather scant
skirt to show its beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more! Is that all? And you one of the greatest
heiresses in the land, my lady says!&#8221; cried Barnes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
looking with infinite scorn upon the simple blue flannel
dress which its wearer thought so fine. &#8220;Well! If that
ain&#8217;t odd! Come. We&#8217;ll go down now, and I warn you
again&mdash;mind the stairs!&#8221;</p>

<small>BUSTER TAKES A CITY TRAIL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> life could have been in greater contrast to that of
Sobrante than this upon which the young Californian
now entered. Her own first letter home may best describe
it, written soon after her arrival in Washington
Square, and while her impressions were still vivid.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Darlingest, Dearest Mother</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;We got here all safe and sound, after a nice journey.
I was so homesick at first I thought I should die. Then
Mr. Hale sent me to do something for a dear old Irish
lady in the two sections ahead of ours. It was my section,
too, afterwards when the sick mother and the Baby
came. I found them in the tourist car&mdash;tourists can be
real nice sometimes, mother dear&mdash;we&#8217;d made mistakes
thinking they couldn&#8217;t be, there at home. But Mr. Hale
says the world is full of all sorts of people and rude tourists
and polite tourists are two of those sorts. Besides,
our Cousin Margaret Dalrymple thinks it&#8217;s not being a
tourist makes the difference. It&#8217;s &#8216;born in folks to be
refined or coarse, and one can&#8217;t help nature.&#8217; She thinks
it&#8217;s &#8216;born in me,&#8217; to be quite nice, but that&#8217;s no credit to
me; she says I had the advantage to be a Waldron.
Being a Waldron is, I guess, being everything &#8216;correct.&#8217;
I&#8217;m very glad we&#8217;re all Waldrons together, you and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Cousin Margaret, and darling Ned, and I. It seems to be
a great help in doing just what one ought to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it dear and sweet and just perfectly lovely of
&#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; to steal away and come to take care of me?
Mr. Hale said he was afraid you Sobrante people would
be worried about him, so he telegraphed right back to
tell you where he was. I hope you got that message
sooner than we used to those which came by way of
Marion; but, of course, you did&mdash;since now we have a
little station of our very own right at &#8216;the Sobrante.&#8217;
Queer. My Cousin Margaret and some people who have
come to this house seem to think it&#8217;s a wonderful thing,
that having a copper mine in the family. I don&#8217;t! I
think it&#8217;s horrid. If it hadn&#8217;t been for that old stuff
being dug out of the earth I&#8217;d never have had to come
away here to be educated. Am I not getting educated
fast? Yet I&#8217;ve learned to write thus much better just
from you and Mr. Ninian teaching me at home. I am
taking the greatest pains to do all you want me to.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the queerest, quaintest old house in the city,
some of the visitors say. That our Cousin Margaret has
been offered an enormous price for it but won&#8217;t sell it,
even though she would get all that money and &#8216;the neighborhood
isn&#8217;t what it used to be.&#8217; Even she says that,
and complains most bitterly about the &#8216;parvenusers&#8217;
that have crept into it. There are stores and artists&#8217;
studios and apartment places and&mdash;all sorts of things
that a Waldron doesn&#8217;t like in the Square, nowadays.
But Cousin Margaret says that once only the &#8216;inner circle
of society&#8217; dwelt in these old houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of old: that is one word you must never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
apply to our Cousin Margaret. I thought I&#8217;d best tell
you in case you didn&#8217;t know. I shouldn&#8217;t have known,
not right at first, if Barnes hadn&#8217;t told me. Barnes says
that the older and more worn-out the things are the better
pleased Mrs. Dalrymple is. She is so proud of everything
in the &#8216;mansion&#8217; being just the same as it was in
her own grandfather&#8217;s time, that she won&#8217;t even buy new
chairs for the kitchen nor have new plumbing put in,
even though the health officers have been trying to make
her do that. That&#8217;s why she can never keep cooks and
people like that, of the &#8216;lower classes,&#8217; you know.
Barnes says there have been four new cooks this very
last week that ever was, and I guess each one is stupider
than the other. I know Wun Lung would have been
ashamed to put such stuff on our table at home as we had
here that first luncheon. (We spell lunch with an &#8216;eon&#8217;
at our Cousin Margaret&#8217;s.) As for dear Aunt Sally, I
believe she would have got up and tossed the whole mess
out into the garden for the chickens to eat. Only there
aren&#8217;t any chickens and Aunt Sally wasn&#8217;t here.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ephraim was; and that is the best thing has
happened this dozen years, Tipkins says. You used to
know Tipkins, so, of course, you know too that he
&#8216;wouldn&#8217;t demean himself to cook anything&#8217; unless his
Madam was really starving, and then he&#8217;d make Barnes
do it. He is the only one can make Barnes do things
she doesn&#8217;t like. My Cousin Margaret can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s
Barnes makes Cousin Margaret. But Barnes said she
was a lady&#8217;s-maid and she wouldn&#8217;t demean, either.
Ephraim thinks there&#8217;s a &#8216;touch of sentiment in Barnes&#8217;s
heart for Tipkins&#8217; and that&#8217;s why she minds him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>&mdash;<i>sometimes</i>!
Ephraim wishes she would get the
same sort of &#8216;touch&#8217; for him, then she wouldn&#8217;t order
him to do things he really doesn&#8217;t like. Mr. Hale
thought Cousin Margaret would be angry with &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217;
for coming and send him away, but she wasn&#8217;t
at all. She thinks it is perfectly &#8216;correct and Waldron-y&#8217;
to have a man belonging to you. She was a little vexed
that you didn&#8217;t send a &#8216;maid&#8217; with me, too, till I told her
you hadn&#8217;t any maid to send. Our maids were both
Chinese &#8216;boys&#8217; and had never combed a girl&#8217;s hair in
their lives nor buttoned a frock.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the best part about Ephraim is that now he is
the cook. Seems that when he was offered that first
luncheon he looked it over and turned up his nose about
it. Said he reckoned he was in a city where they could
buy victuals ready cooked if a body was such a fool he
couldn&#8217;t cook them himself. And would he go out and
get something fit to eat? And Tipkins asked, had he any
money? Then Ephraim had to own that he hadn&#8217;t. It
had taken his very last cent to pay his own fare here from
home and to pay Buster&#8217;s fare, too. Think of that? The
darling old &#8216;boy&#8217; had hired Buster brought on by express,
in a car all by himself, because there weren&#8217;t any
cattle cars on our train, and it had cost&mdash;Oh! dear! I
don&#8217;t yet know how much. Ephy won&#8217;t tell. Anyway,
he&#8217;d struck his bottom dollar when he reached Washington
Square&mdash;had just enough to hire the hackman to
bring Buster to the house for him. So he&#8217;s here, in the
stable behind, with our Cousin Margaret&#8217;s black span,
who are as old, seems if, as everything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asking him if he had money for the food made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Ephraim mad. So he said that if he hadn&#8217;t he had sense
enough to cook it, if there was any to cook. Then Tipkins
hurried off and bought a great basket full of everything
nice, and that night we had such a dinner as would
have done even Aunt Sally credit. There was quite a
tilt between those two funny old men! Tipkins, he said
<i>he</i> was the butler, and as long as there was a woman
under the roof it wasn&#8217;t a man&#8217;s place to handle a gridiron,
and so he wouldn&#8217;t demean to cook. Ephraim said
<i>he&#8217;d</i> been everything under the sun a man could be&mdash;except
a nasty, high-flown English butler! He&#8217;d worn the
United States&#8217; military uniform, and he&#8217;d dug gold out
of California mountains, and taught the nicest girl in the
universe to sharpshoot to beat the militia&mdash;That was me!
Wasn&#8217;t it nice of him to say that?&mdash;and he guessed rather
than let that girl what had done him so proud go and
starve for want of decent food he&#8217;d tackle the first frying-pan
came his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there he is, installed in the great, dreary kitchen
downstairs, where it&#8217;s so dark I wonder he can see at
all, and just as proud now of the fine things he fixes as
he used to be of me when I hit the bull&#8217;s-eye. And our
Cousin Margaret is perfectly delighted with him. She
isn&#8217;t a bit ashamed to say that her stomach has a good
deal to do with her temper, and that if the first is satisfied
the last is sure to be. That&#8217;s a good thing about Cousin
Margaret. She isn&#8217;t a bit afraid to say anything she
thinks about&mdash;about all that <i>is</i>, except her own age. I
don&#8217;t mean, course, that she would tell a wrong story
about that, even, if anybody would dare to ask, but I
can&#8217;t fancy anybody daring. She is such a beautiful old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
lady&mdash;gentlewoman, I should say. She&#8217;s like you in that,
she thinks that is the correctest word. She wears
clothes that even I, who don&#8217;t know much about such
matters, know are perfectly beautiful. Shining, shimmery
silks&mdash;like the sunlight on the arroyo when there&#8217;s
water in it; made long and draggy like our peacocks&#8217;
own tails and her hair&mdash;Why, mother dearest! Even
your beautiful hair isn&#8217;t half so much as hers. It&#8217;s
piled on top of her head in what she calls a &#8216;pompydoor,&#8217;
and dips down behind all in little crinkles, like mine
after it&#8217;s been washed; and her skin is so white, I don&#8217;t
believe she ever went out into the sunshine without her
veil to keep it off. Her eyes are black and snappy and
she never wears glasses, like the &#8216;boys&#8217; do, except in
what Barnes calls the &#8216;privacy of her bedchamber.&#8217; I&#8217;ve
never seen that privacy and I should be afraid to sleep
in her bedchamber. It&#8217;s the front room upstairs, with
three great windows and an &#8216;alcove.&#8217; In the &#8216;alcove&#8217; is
a big, big bed, all stuffy curtains and things around it
and so high there&#8217;s a little ladder to climb up. There
are looking-glasses all about and so many chairs and
wardrobes and things I shouldn&#8217;t think she could hardly
move about. I have seen it all from the hall, going to
my own room at the back, but I&#8217;ve never been invited in
and I wouldn&#8217;t dare to go without being asked. That&#8217;s
the one thing about our Cousin Margaret. I guess it&#8217;s
what you call &#8216;stately.&#8217; She keeps people from daring,
all except Barnes. Even the persons who call and stay
in the drawing-room act afraid of Madam. Her reception
days are like a queen&#8217;s, Tipkins says. There is to
be one, to-morrow; the &#8216;last of the season.&#8217; She sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Barnes down somewhere to buy me a white frock, with
blue ribbons and white shoes and stockings. I am to
wear it at the reception and be presented, for a few
minutes, because I am &#8216;Gabriella&#8217;s child.&#8217; Then I am to
be sent away again. That seems silly to me: to spend
money for a frock to wear only a few minutes, but I
wouldn&#8217;t dare say so to Madame Dalrymple.</p>

<p>&#8220;My room is the one you used to have. I wonder how
you could sleep in it without being afraid. I can&#8217;t. So
Ephy comes upstairs and sleeps on a cot outside the
door. <i>I</i> was never afraid in all my life before, but I am
here. Everything is so big and dark and heavy. I feel
as if I were carrying mountains on my chest, and I&#8217;d
give&mdash;Oh! what wouldn&#8217;t I give to jump on Buster&#8217;s
bare back and scamper up the canyon as fast as he could
go! Cousin Margaret was nice about Buster, too. She
says it is quite a distinction to have a real Californian
with her <i>caballero</i> and broncho to ride alongside her
carriage when she goes out driving in the Park. We
are going this afternoon. But I don&#8217;t feel as glad as I
ought, because I must wear the funniest kind of a habit,
with a long flapping skirt, and Ephraim must put on some
stiff-looking things she calls suitable for a groom.
Cousin Margaret has bought these clothes for us, too, all
ready-made, and Ephraim says he is plumb disgusted,
and that he will feel like a fool. I hope he won&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t
imagine darling &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; feeling like anybody except
his own sensible self.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dearest mother, I must stop. I promised
Cousin Margaret I would have my new riding things on
at precisely four o&#8217;clock. When she says four o&#8217;clock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
she doesn&#8217;t mean a minute before that time nor a minute
after. The first lesson she is trying to teach me is&mdash;is
&#8216;punctuerality&#8217; or something like that. She says that to
be exact is another mark of a gentlewoman, and dear me!
It seems that being a gentlewoman here in New York,
with Madam to watch me, is lots harder than being one
at dear Sobrante, with only your sweet smile to guide
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;P.S. I have written you a long, long letter. I have
felt as if I were talking to you and I have talked right
out. The reason it is done so well is that Cousin Margaret
has read it all over and corrected it and made me
copy it. She said she would have liked to strike out
some of my sentences; that they &#8216;suggested a coarseness
which must have come from the Trent side of my nature,&#8217;
and that no girl, purely Waldron, would have put
them in. However, it was her own dignity as a Waldron
which kept her from the striking out. She was willing
to correct the spelling and writing, though she left some
mistakes for you to see, so that you might know how
much I need that education I have got to take. Oh!
dear! It sounds like a dose of castor oil, or Aunt Sally&#8217;s
picra! Or even like a great big club <i>I</i> must be cudgelled
with. Never mind. I&#8217;ll &#8216;tackle&#8217; that old education
with everything that is in me, so that I can get it
over and done with and travel home to you again. The
last part of this letter I have not had to have corrected;
and the next one I write I&#8217;ll try to make so perfect she&#8217;ll
not wish to read any more. If our Cousin Margaret
would only love me a little tiny bit! or let me love her.
I so long to hear somebody say &#8216;darling&#8217; or &#8216;precious,&#8217; or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
anything else that would make me know they cared.
Only Ephraim does now and then, but has to say it on
&#8216;the sly&#8217; as he calls it. When Cousin Margaret doesn&#8217;t
hear. It would be beneath a Waldron&#8217;s dignity to be
familiar with a servant&mdash;and she considers darling
&#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; such. He only laughs about it; though,
all the same, I believe he&#8217;s met what Marty calls his
&#8216;come-uppance&#8217; in our Cousin Margaret. She likes
him, treats him well enough, but keeps him at arms&#8217;
length as if he were some sort of a &#8216;creature&#8217; and he is
more afraid of her than even Tipkins. He says that&#8217;s
because if he offended she would send him away and he
won&#8217;t be sent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, good-by, good-by! O my mother! If I
had your arms about me just this minute! After all I
have left a blank page. That is for you to fill up with
kisses and love, love, love&mdash;to you, and Ned, and every
single body on that dear Sobrante ranch. Oh! why did
old Pedro ever show us that copper mine? If he hadn&#8217;t
I wouldn&#8217;t have been one of &#8216;the richest girls&#8217; nor have
had an education! I should have just stayed happily at
home and been only a loving</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Daughter Jessica</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>There was a tap at the door and the girl carefully
folded and sealed the envelope, while a small colored
girl, one of the various &#8220;emergencies&#8221; as Ephraim called
the shifting &#8220;extra help&#8221; summoned almost daily, announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Madam she done want you-all to come right
along downstairs and go a-ridin&#8217; with her. She says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
you-all must ha&#8217; heerd the big clock strike an&#8217; should
ha&#8217; paid your own attention, miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica sprang up, tripped in the skirt of her riding
habit, and fell on the floor, while the messenger first
stared then burst into a loud guffaw. That was a sort of
noise not permitted in that old mansion and both she and
Jessica were frightened as if they had committed some
misdemeanor, as the latter got upon her feet again and
held the offending skirt high out of the way.</p>

<p>She looked curiously upon the little maid, with whom
she would far rather have stayed and played than to have
ridden in solemn state beside the great carriage of her
cousin. Girls were the greatest novelty of all these many
new things which had come into her life; and the one
redeeming feature about that forthcoming &#8220;education&#8221;
was that it would be prosecuted in company with many
other &#8220;girls.&#8221; However, she dared not tarry, and in a
few moments was in her saddle, with Ephraim riding a
hired hack at the prescribed distance behind her, and
Buster vainly trying to accommodate his paces to her
will and those of the sedate blacks drawing the old
barouche.</p>

<p>For a little time all went well. Jessica was an experienced
mistress of this exercise and felt her spirits
rise as they had not before since reaching the great city.
Mrs. Dalrymple watched her with pride, which had
at first been anxiety, but soon saw that she had no
need to fear for any awkwardness on her young cousin&#8217;s
part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, you do well. You might have been
trained in our best riding academy,&#8221; commended the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Madam, with satisfaction. &#8220;It is the characteristic of a
gentlewoman to be an accomplished equestrienne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica smiled and cast a meaning glance backward into
Ephraim&#8217;s face, which he was trying to compose into
that impassive stolidity of Mrs. Dalrymple&#8217;s own coachman
and footman. But he failed and the most he could
accomplish was an ignominious wink. Tipkins had duly
instructed him as to the &#8220;correct&#8221; behavior on this his
appearance as &#8220;groom,&#8221; but that teacher would have
been shocked through all his English soul had he seen that
contorted wink.</p>

<p>Then they found their way into Fifth Avenue, and
this seemed to Jessica the prettiest part of the town that
she had seen, with its aristocratic, comparative quiet;
and here Mrs. Dalrymple explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;That brown-stone house on the corner, the right
side of the street, is Madam Mearsom&#8217;s school, where I
shall place you at the beginning of the fall term. It is
the most fashionable and exclusive of all our private
schools and it is where your mother was trained. I shall
take you to call upon her soon, and have already entered
your name upon her list. Commonly, a pupil has
to be enrolled at least two years before there is a vacancy
in her limited classes; but Madam has made an exception
in your favor because, as she admitted, she has always
had the honor of educating the Waldrons. I hope
you will appreciate the concession and never forget the
high ideals you must maintain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try, Cousin Margaret,&#8221; dutifully replied &#8220;little
Captain,&#8221; though feeling that the &#8220;Waldrons and their
ideals&#8221; were a burden too heavy for her to bear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>&#8220;Now we must turn aside, into a cross street, to see
my dressmaker. I don&#8217;t know why such persons always
<i>will</i> live on cross streets! It&#8217;s most annoying, they are
so much narrower and confusing. Notice, child, how
our New York is laid out. As simple as a checker-board&mdash;from
First Street up, all the cross streets go by
count, and all the Avenues in the same order, until you
come to that far-away East Side where they are lettered.
But neither you nor I will ever have more to do with
Avenues A, B, or C, than to know they do exist and
are marked on the city map.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coachman drew up before a house which seemed
to be familiar both to him and the blacks, which settled
down into a sleepy attitude, quite unfitting such aristocratic
beasts but that indicated their prescience of a long
wait. The Madam was helped from the carriage and had
to pause a moment, as always when she made any physical
exertion, before ascending the steps. Then she passed
up them with the ease of a much younger woman and
was promptly admitted.</p>

<p>It was there that disaster fell. Buster had been growing
more and more restive. Jessica&#8217;s unfamiliar skirt
fretted his delicate skin; the saddle was not his old one
fitting comfortably to his back; this enforced pacing,
pacing, was intolerable to a broncho of spirit; this standing
quiet was more annoying even than the pacing had
been; and when a honking automobile came dashing
around the corner of the block, almost into his very face,
he cast one terrified, reproachful glance into his rider&#8217;s
eyes and took the bit in his teeth.</p>

<p>Oh! but he traveled then! Ephraim pursuing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
using most objectionable language to the hack he bestrode.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you vile beast! Call yourself a horse, do you?
well, you don&#8217;t know what a horse is, I tell you! Get up!
Get on! <i>Vamos!</i> Speed! Even old Stiffleg, that deserted
me on the streets of Los Angeles, had more fire in
him than you, poor old worn-out New Yorker! <i>Vamos!</i>
<i>V-A-M-O-S!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In vain. Jessica had vanished. The broncho, unused
to city sights and sounds, would not be checked nor
swerved from the mad course he had elected to follow.
The most she could do was to keep her seat upon his back
and this she managed, even though hampered by that
detestable skirt and that slippery new saddle. Barebacked,
without this handicap, how she would have
reveled in that mad ride! even now, knowing that her
Cousin Margaret&#8217;s dire displeasure awaited her return,
she did revel in it. Almost she could fancy herself tearing
across the plain, where no obstruction offered and the
soft sod was a cushioned pathway for Buster&#8217;s hoofs,
and for a moment closing her eyes, she let her fancy
carry her back to Paraiso d&#8217;Oro; and Buster&mdash;whither he
would.</p>

<p>But she opened them again in terror, as a wild scream
came from beneath those hoofs and the broncho was so
suddenly checked that he almost threw her off backward.</p>

<p>The inevitable had happened on that crowded thoroughfare
into which he had now turned. She and he had
been ignorantly reckless of consequences and most untoward
consequences had resulted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<small>JESSICA&#8217;S FIRST GIRL FRIEND.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> screams came from a girl of Jessica&#8217;s own age,
whom Buster had ridden down and thrown to the pavement.
But they were instantly taken up and repeated by
a score of throats, while a crowd assembled on the spot,
as if it had risen from the ground itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! have I killed her?&#8221; cried &#8220;Little Captain,&#8221; as
swiftly realizing the accident, and almost as swiftly,
leaping from her saddle to bend above the girl who now
lay with closed eyes and white face, apparently unconscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s awful!&#8221; cried somebody. &#8220;It&#8217;s against
the law for folks to ride that gait!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest her, officer! Don&#8217;t let her get away!&#8221; advised
another on-looker, as a policeman laid his hand on
the broncho&#8217;s bridle and held the creature still, save for
an exciting trembling through all its frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to &#8216;get away&#8217;! I want to take care of
this poor girl!&#8221; retorted Jessica, lifting her head and
discovering the officer. &#8220;O sir! I am so sorry. We
didn&#8217;t see her, Buster nor I, and what can I do? Is there
a hospital near? Is she&mdash;Do you think&mdash;she <i>can&#8217;t</i> be
dead, all in a little minute like that! Tell me, help me&mdash;help
her&mdash;Please, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the mention of hospital the girl still lying on the
pavement opened her eyes and tried to rise, and willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
hands helped her to do so. She did gain her feet, quivering
and terrified still, yet managing to protest with vigor:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no! I won&#8217;t go! Not to a hospital&mdash;I won&#8217;t,
I won&#8217;t! See? I ain&#8217;t hurted. I can walk&mdash;I shan&#8217;t&mdash;I
shan&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>In truth she was not really injured save by the shock
of falling, which had rendered her senseless for a little;
until that word &#8220;hospital&#8221;&mdash;so dreaded by the very
poor&mdash;pierced her consciousness. Buster had run
against and knocked her down, but it was the blow upon
the stones which had done the most mischief.</p>

<p>With tears of pity and regret dimming her own blue
eyes, Jessica slipped a sustaining arm around the other&#8217;s
waist and eagerly assured her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor shall you go if you&#8217;re not really hurt. You
shall go home, right home, if you&#8217;ll tell me where and
this policeman will get a carriage for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Californian was making prompt use of the knowledge
she had already gained concerning this strange city.
Policemen were the proper persons to direct, in time of
trouble, and carriages might be had at any and all times
and everywhere. Street-cars were confusingly abundant
but of these she knew nothing and was afraid.</p>

<p>It was the officer who recalled her to the fact that
hiring carriages costs money, and:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you pay for it, miss? Your name and address,
please. Whoa, there, you brute! Was there nobody
with you? Don&#8217;t you know better than to ride like that,
right here in the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. My name is Jessica Trent. I&#8217;m just
from California and I don&#8217;t know much about New York.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
My cousin, Mrs. Dalrymple, lives at Number &mdash;&mdash; Washington
Square, and I live with her. She has money, and
will pay the carriage man. I haven&#8217;t any&mdash;not here.
But I wasn&#8217;t alone, only that old hired horse wouldn&#8217;t
travel and&mdash;Ah! here he comes! Ephraim, Ephraim!&#8221;</p>

<p>Though he had failed to keep her in sight, the despised
hack-horse had had intelligence enough to follow the
course his late companion, Buster, had taken, and now
brought &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; to his &#8220;Captain&#8217;s&#8221; side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Lady Jess! Whatever&#8217;s this?&#8221; demanded the
astonished ranchman, beholding his beloved child standing
in the middle of the street, with her arm about the
waist of a ragged, hunchbacked girl, and a tray full of
flowers lying on the stones before them. The flowers
were sadly trampled and bruised, and Buster had planted
one restless hoof plump through the wicker tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;We run over, or knocked her down, this dear,
poor little flower-girl, I guess she is. I want to get a
carriage and take her home. Have you got any money?
This policeman says I must have it first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim slowly dismounted and slipping his own
horse&#8217;s bridle over one arm, coolly relieved the officer of
Buster&#8217;s, much to the delight of that person in uniform.
Then he demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the taxes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The&mdash;what?&#8221; asked the policeman, in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The taxes, the cost, the price of that there carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably a dollar or two. Depends on where the
girl lives and how long it takes. Say, Sis, I&#8217;ve seen you
around here before. You&#8217;ve been careless more&#8217;n once
and a cripple like you&#8217;d better take no chances.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>For reply the flower-seller made a saucy face and
stooped to gather up her scattered posies, critically
calculating the damage done to them and the consequent
loss to her. She had recovered from her brief unconsciousness
and as Jessica also began to collect the daffodils
and tulips, exclaiming with delight over their beauty,
her business instinct came to the fore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five cents a bunch, miss. Only five cents!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet it was almost mechanically she spoke, for all her
hearing was strained to learn the outcome of that
carriage-discussion; and regardless of further injury to her
blossoms, she clapped her thin hands in delight, as
Ephraim settled it by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it up, officer! I reckon we can stand that much.
No, you needn&#8217;t worry about the broncho. I&#8217;ll lead him
and follow the carriage. But you&#8217;ll have to give the
orders&mdash;This old New York of yours sets a plainsman
plumb crazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer found no cause for delay. He had made a
few entries in his note book. The hunchback was not
injured, she didn&#8217;t need a carriage, but if these wild
Westerners fancied that she did and were able to pay for
it, that was their business.</p>

<p>When the summoned hack drew up to the curbstone,
whither the two girls had retreated when the crowd dispersed,
the flower-seller&#8217;s pale face really glowed almost
as pink as Jessica&#8217;s own, and her ill-shod feet danced on
the stones, as she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s true! What&#8217;ll they say when they
see me? Oh! my soul and body! Oh! my!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to tell where you live,&#8221; said Jessica, following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
the other into the vehicle and smiling at her eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. I know how. This is the way they do it,
I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em, lots of times, waiting outside the
theaters and such. The ladies they steps in, just like I did,
and they speaks up at the coachy and they says:
&#8216;Home&#8217;! Or maybe, &#8216;Waldorf &#8217;Storia,&#8217; or &#8216;Fifth
Avenoo,&#8217; or wherever &#8217;tis. &#8216;Hark. Hear me! Driver,
221 Avenoo A. Back tenement, top floor.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It might have been that palatial Waldorf Astoria, to
which she had referred, rather than one of the dingiest
abodes on that street which was named by a letter, and
that Madam Dalrymple had said was too humble for any
Waldron to know about. Yet here was Jessica going to
it, must go, or be guilty of a rudeness less &#8220;Waldrony&#8221;
than even that knowledge of poor Avenue A; and it never
entered her mind that she could send the hunchback home,
unattended. Though, indeed, it is doubtful if she could,
for the hackman would not, in that case, have felt at
all sure of his fare.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Ephraim knew little and cared less for
any street distinctions. He was simply and wholly
disgusted by this whole outing. The horse he bestrode
was never meant for a saddle; his groom&#8217;s livery was
uncomfortable in the matter of fit&mdash;as well as pride; the
restless Buster was extremely difficult to lead, where
peril of the streets was constantly menacing, and only
love for &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; prevented his turning about
and making straight for Washington Square, even though
he had to ask directions thither at every block.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Sophy Nestor. What&#8217;s yours? Ain&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
this jolly? I&#8217;m the gladdest ever was &#8217;t that horse of
yours knocked me down. My! But didn&#8217;t the cop want
to hurry me off to the hospital! No, &#8217;twasn&#8217;t him,
though, &#8217;twas your own plaguy self! Do you know what
a hospital is? It&#8217;s a place where they take folks to cut
off their legs and things. We poor folks is what keeps
the hospitals goin&#8217;. Them doctors they catch us and cut
us just to learn how the rich folkses&#8217; insides are made.
&#8217;Cause that way, Granny says, we&#8217;re just as good as the
rich ones, our insides are. But, maybe, you didn&#8217;t know.
Else, you&#8217;d never ha&#8217; said it. What&#8217;d you say it was?
Oh! I&#8217;m so happy! I never, never was so happy in my
life! Won&#8217;t the children in our court and all along the
block just stare their eyes out when they see me come
ridin&#8217; home in a reg&#8217;lar carriage! I never thought I&#8217;d
be inside one, never in all my life. What&#8217;d you say it
was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t said, but it&#8217;s Jessica Trent. And is it possible
that right here in this city full of all sorts of
wagons that you&#8217;ve never ridden before?&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage had now passed eastward through the
city and even to the Westerner&#8217;s untrained sight the
streets looked more crowded, the buildings poorer and
dingier, and the passing throngs altogether different from
those upon Fifth Avenue. But she observed less of the
surroundings than of this chattering girl beside her. So
misshapen, so wretchedly clothed, and so radiantly happy!
She had longed for a playmate of her own age but she
had not dreamed of one like this.</p>

<p>In a few moments they had exchanged the fullest confidences.
Sophy had listened wide-eyed and, at first, unbelieving,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
to Jessica&#8217;s story of a home where one couldn&#8217;t
even see another house, because it was so far away;
but she had gradually accepted the fact and was lost in
admiration of a girl who could live such a wonderful
life yet be so friendly and nice to a mere flower-girl
from &#8220;Avenoo A.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached that dilapidated block where Sophy
lived, and with a great air that young person had
ordered the driver to stop, she turned to Jessica and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll get out. Oh! my soul and body! It&#8217;s all
clean over and done with! <i>It didn&#8217;t last.</i> Seems if it
didn&#8217;t last a minute. Say, Jessica, if I should go back to
that place some other day would you ride round and let
your horse knock me down again, so&#8217;s I could come home
in another carriage? Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I would not! But&mdash;but if you care so much
about it and will put on a whole frock and come to
Washington Square I&#8217;ll ask my Cousin Margaret
Dalrymple to take you with us in hers. But I guess I
won&#8217;t get out. I&mdash;I&#8217;d rather not. She might not like it;&#8221;
answered Jessie, more in answer to a warning nod from
Ephraim who had now come up to them than from any
reluctance of her own. It was, truly, a strange and most
unlovely place. Lines of ragged clothing fluttered from
every floor, children rolled in the gutters and fought each
other savagely at the least provocation, street vendors
yelled till the air was full of discord, and the whole
surroundings told of that abject poverty which Jessica now
beheld for the first time. Yet it interested her wonderfully,
more because it was new than because she understood
it. So, when Sophy insisted, she disregarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Ephraim&#8217;s warning and sprang to the sidewalk, smiling
in spite of herself at the hunchback&#8217;s uptossed head and
the remarkable strut she assumed for the benefit of
onlookers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you <i>must</i>, Jessica Trent. Else Granny won&#8217;t
believe it&#8217;s true and&#8217;ll nag me &#8217;cause the basket&#8217;s broke.
I&#8217;ll come to Washington Square all right, but I can&#8217;t&mdash;I
can&#8217;t put on a whole frock. I haven&#8217;t got one. This way,
right this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seizing Jessica&#8217;s hand so forcibly she could not
withdraw it, Sophy hurriedly led the way through a sort of
dark, damp alley, running between two houses, to
another tall tenement facing a court in the rear. Here
there were more clothes-lines, more fluttering garments,
more crying babies, and more outrageous odors. Instinctively,
the stranger pinched her nose to protect it
against the stench, while Sophy consolingly remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;The smell ain&#8217;t nothing when you get used to it.
Granny used to mind it awful, when we first moved here
from over Brooklyn way. That was &#8217;fore I can remember
an&#8217; my father was killed. She don&#8217;t now. She don&#8217;t
mind anything only having to <i>live</i>. She&#8217;s dreadful tired
of that, Granny is, &#8217;cause she don&#8217;t much like the folks in
the houses. I like &#8217;em all right. Mind the steps! That
third one isn&#8217;t there, and there&#8217;s a hole in all of &#8217;em.
I&#8217;ve got so used I know just where to step, even in the
dark. Now, one more and we&#8217;ll be to Granny&#8217;s door.
How funny you breathe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t hardly breathe at all! It&#8217;s so&mdash;so
awful high&mdash;and&mdash;smelly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pinch it again. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t so bad in Granny&#8217;s room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
She keeps the winder open all the time. Say, Granny,
Granny Briggs! Here&#8217;s Jessica Trent, away from California,
wherever that is, and her horse she was a-ridin&#8217;
on Thirty-fourth Street knocked me silly and broke the
basket, and she brung me home in a carriage, <i>in a
carriage</i>, Granny Briggs! And you needn&#8217;t say she
didn&#8217;t, &#8217;cause you can go right down into the Aveny
and see it standin&#8217; on the stones a-waitin&#8217; to take her
back again to where she come from. True&#8217;s I live.
You can see her for yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica made her best, most &#8220;Waldron-y&#8221; courtesy,
and with a grace hardly to have been looked for in such
a place, the aged mistress of the one room returned it.
She was a comely old body, rather ragged than untidy,
and she wore a broad frilled cap on her head, and a piece
of a frayed shawl pinned about her shoulders. She had
a great pile of men&#8217;s overalls before her, to which she
was putting the finishing stitches, &#8220;by hand,&#8221; the only
sort of sewing she could get to do, and for which she
was paid a miserable price. But it, and Sophy&#8217;s flower-selling,
was their only source of income, and she could
afford to waste no time, even to talk with this astonishing
young visitor who had come.</p>

<p>So she rose once, bobbed a returning courtesy to Jessica&#8217;s
profound one, and settled back in her chair, having
scarcely paused at all in her work. Then, still sewing
as if her life depended on her speed&mdash;as indeed it did&mdash;she
listened in silence to the story Sophy told, only opening
her lips once to remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity the pony didn&#8217;t finish you up while it was about
it, my poor child. Life isn&#8217;t worth living for such as you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Or me either,&#8221; she added gloomily, and wondering why
the Californian didn&#8217;t depart. She wished she would.
Sophy would have to carry home part of these garments
before the shop closed for the night and poor folks had
no time for idling. She expressed her desire rather
promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;ve done talking, get the leather piece
and wrap this work up. If you hurry you&#8217;ll get there in
time and since you&#8217;ve wasted all them flowers you&#8217;d better
step lively. There&#8217;s just one half-loaf in this cupboard
and you&#8217;re amazing hungry&mdash;for such as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. You help, Jessie, please,&#8221; cried Sophy; and
then, as if inspired by some wonderful idea, raised herself
from the floor where she was spreading the piece of carriage-cloth
used to enwrap the heavy overalls on their
journeys to and from &#8220;the shop,&#8221; and exclaimed: &#8220;Oh!
let&#8217;s do it! Let&#8217;s ask that nice driver to carry us &#8217;round
by the factory on our way to Washington Square and
carry the bundle with us. Won&#8217;t that be grand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica hesitated. She feared she was already doing
something her guardian would disapprove, yet otherwise
felt no sense of guilt. But instantly her hesitation vanished,
remembering that she had forewarned Mrs.
Dalrymple that there might be times when she could not
be obedient, when her own sense of what was right&mdash;for
herself&mdash;interfered with Madam&#8217;s judgment. This was
one of the times! She was sure of it.</p>

<p>Ephraim had nearly &#8220;lost his head&#8221; in his anxiety,
tied to his waiting outside with the two horses which he
could neither leave nor lose; and his patience entirely
gave way when the two girls reappeared, tugging a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
mighty bundle between them, Jessica tripping in her unfamiliar
skirt, but Sophy radiant in her rags and in the
prospect of another ride.</p>

<p>What the driver felt was best expressed by the fierce
glance he shot the sharpshooter, with whom he had had
a most enjoyable talk during their long wait, and by his
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I look to you, sir, for payment for all this nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect of this was to turn Ephraim&#8217;s wrath from
his &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; upon the city jehu, and to make
him retort, savagely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Plague take your cautious soul! You shall be paid
and double paid and don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour later there entered the aristocratic but now
most anxious presence of Madam Dalrymple, two brightly
smiling girls, chattering in the friendliest manner, and
one of them explaining:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Cousin Margaret, that Buster ran away,
and yet I&#8217;m not sorry only for fear you didn&#8217;t like it.
This is Sophy Nestor and she lives on Avenue A. I&#8217;ve
been to see where she lives, after Buster knocked her
down, and now she&#8217;s come to see us, and I&#8217;m going up to
get one of my frocks to give her, &#8217;cause she hasn&#8217;t any
whole one. And please, will you give me five dollars to
pay the hackman? And for fifty cents more he&#8217;d carry
her back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>This explanation was received in ominous silence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<small>EPHRAIM TAKES HOME THE BUNDLE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> silence was broken by Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s dispatching
Tipkins to pay the waiting hackman. But the
additional fifty cents was not forthcoming. In its stead
a dime was given Sophy and she was, also, dispatched
with a crispness that forbade her accompanying Jessica
upstairs, in search of a new frock, and that sent &#8220;her
about her business&#8221; with the reminder that she was to
trouble that house no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have the matter of the accident investigated
and proper restitution made. You can give Tipkins
your address, Sophy Nestor, and need not wait for
Jessica to come downstairs. Tipkins, show the small
person out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophy stared but did not disobey, even though her
soul longed for one more glimpse of the lovely girl who
had crossed her pathway, for a moment, so to speak, and
had vanished within the gloom of that forbidding mansion.
She was an impudent street child, in ordinary,
ready to &#8220;sass&#8221; anybody who interfered with her and
all the more &#8220;touchy&#8221; because of her deformity and the
curiosity it aroused. But she dared not sauce this wonderful
old lady, who looked to her like some of the fashionably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
draped wax figures in modistes&#8217; windows and
whose voice was so icily quiet and stern.</p>

<p>She followed Tipkins&#8217; wake with a meekness hitherto
unknown, but a meekness that was external only.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! She owns the inside of this house, she does,
but she don&#8217;t own the whole street, so there. And I&#8217;ll
take my stand right out here in the Square, and here I&#8217;ll
sell my flowers&mdash;or bust! Then I&#8217;ll see Jessica and if
she can&#8217;t give it to me to-day, she&#8217;ll give me that frock
some other day. I hope it won&#8217;t be like that riding one
she had on, all tight and draggley, but&mdash;Goody! Them
ten centses &#8217;ll buy a real lot of daffies offen the market
folks, when market&#8217;s done, to-morrow. I won&#8217;t ride in
no street car, I won&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ll be right here in this Square
early to-morrow morning, and Jessie and me can talk
through that iron fence, same&#8217;s if we was close together.
Them lions is only iron, too, and I&#8217;m not a bit scared
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>These reflections passed through the hunchback&#8217;s mind
as she received the dime from Tipkins and had the door
of the mansion closed in her face. Then she seated
herself on a bench in the park till she remembered that in
leaving the hack she had left the bundle of fresh work in
it, which she was taking home to Granny. At that memory
she sprang up dismayed and hurried homeward, fearing
many things but most of all that she would have to
go without food for many meals to come because of her
forgetfulness. Granny wouldn&#8217;t punish her. She rarely
did by word or blow; but Sophy&#8217;s worst punishment
would be the fact that the bundle of goods was lost and
that Granny would have to make it good. Poor Granny!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
So old and so discouraged! Yet so much nicer in every
way, the loyal grandchild thought, than that rich old
lady in the mansion she had left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Cousin Margaret! Where has Sophy gone?&#8221;
asked Jessica, hurrying back to the room where she had
left her visitor, with her own prettiest frock on her arm;
even that beloved one of white with scarlet trimmings
which had been made for the happy <i>Navidad</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;To where she belongs, I hope. Child, you must
never, never do such a thing again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Cousin Margaret, I didn&#8217;t do it. It was Buster,
poor fellow, who was scared almost to death by those
upstairs trains and the automobiles. Why, they scare me,
too, they sound so like a flock of wild geese coming
right down on your head. I hate them. I don&#8217;t see why
people ride in them when there are so many horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For once I agree with you. I also detest them, the
modern, disagreeable things. But that&#8217;s begging the
question. I refer to your disobedience in visiting that
tenement house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;But, Cousin Margaret! I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;you
hadn&#8217;t really forbidden; you&#8217;d only said I needn&#8217;t ever
know anything about poor Avenue A and the folks live
on it, and I wouldn&#8217;t have known only Buster made me.
My mother says nothing happens by accident and that
everything leads to something else. Like this, seems
if: If Buster hadn&#8217;t thrown poor Sophy down, I&#8217;d never
have know how poor she was and had the chance to be
good to her. I&#8217;m going to write my mother soon as I
can and tell her; and that&#8217;s the first time I ever was glad
I was going to be an &#8216;heiress.&#8217; Heiresses have lots of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
money and oh! dear! It will take all we can ever dig
out of that copper mine to take care of all the poor folks
in Avenue A. I shall ask my mother to have you, or
Mr. Hale, or whoever &#8217;tis that keeps the money, to give
me some right away. I can&#8217;t bear to think of any nice
old lady, like Granny Briggs, living in a tiny room with
only a bed and two chairs and a weeny, tiny stove in the
corner. She was so busy she couldn&#8217;t even stop to talk
to me a minute. It made me feel real tired just to look
at her. I&#8217;m going to spend my whole life helping poor
Avenue A people, or others like them, and I&#8217;m going to
begin with Sophy and her grandmother. I just can&#8217;t
forget them, nor&mdash;nor the <i>poor smell</i>! I should hate
that worse of all, that poor smell. Wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalrymple had listened in silence while her small
relative thus unburdened her soul, and now replied with
considerable satisfaction:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Waldron in you. I have tried, and once
Gabriella did, faithfully, to do what is known as &#8216;slumming;&#8217;
but the &#8216;poor smell&#8217; conquered us both. I trust
it will you, and certainly you have made a good beginning,
to detect it so instantly. Now, sit down and listen
to me. You are <i>going</i> to be a rich young woman but
you <i>are</i> not yet. You are but a very inexperienced child,
who has just caught her first glimpse of the &#8216;seamy side&#8217;
of life. It isn&#8217;t a pleasant side, and to you it isn&#8217;t a
necessary one. There are numberless organized charities
to provide for the wants of the poor and I subscribe
to many of them. I will have your name put down upon
one or two lists and it must then content you to know
that you are helping, through others, those who need.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Personally, you can have nothing to do with the abjectly
poor. It isn&#8217;t fitting and it cannot be. So the next time
you are tempted to visit any such tenement as that of
to-day please to remember that you are under my authority
and I forbid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that is a longer lecture than I often give and
I shall not repeat it. You must remember and obey.
Now go, ask Barnes to make a hot bath ready for you
and send everything you have on to the laundry. Except
your habit, which, of course, must go to a professional
cleaner. I feel as if you had brought that &#8216;poor
smell&#8217; into this very house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no, Cousin Margaret, it isn&#8217;t that. It&#8217;s just the
ordinary smell-y kind of air is in here. I noticed it the
moment I got here and Barnes never opens the windows
like she ought. My mother says that the more outdoor
air we get into the house the sweeter it is. Why, Cousin
Margaret, we never close the windows at Sobrante, except
in the rainy season and even then not many of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry not to go right away as you want,
but there&#8217;s something been forgot. We left the bundle
of sewing in that carriage and I promised Sophy this
frock. I couldn&#8217;t break my word, you know, so I will
have to go just the once more and after I find the
carriage. Is it in the street here, still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you tiresome girl! What next? I did not for a
moment suppose that in inviting you to my house I was
going to have its peace so disturbed. Here have I been
fretting away half the afternoon, about your disappearance,
instead of enjoying my drive in the park as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
should. Then when you do come home you do it bringing
some probable infection with you. Those tenements
are never free from some contagious disease, I&#8217;ve read,
and I expect you&#8217;ll come down with scarlet fever, or
diphtheria, or some other terrible thing. That would
mean a health officer visiting and fumigation and other
miserable annoyances.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, no. The hack has disappeared, the bundle of
sewing with it&mdash;if such there was. But you&#8217;ll not go
seek it. I will send Ephraim and with sufficient money
in hand to pay for all possible injuries. Now, call him
and let&#8217;s have done with this unpleasant Nestor-Briggs
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica obeyed, uttering no further protest. Indeed,
if dear old &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; were to take the matter in
hand it would be promptly and well done. Fortunately,
too, it happened that scenting a possible future customer,
the hackman had early in their time of waiting given
Mr. Marsh his carriage number and the address at which
he might usually be found. Thither Ephraim departed,
and shouldering the bundle himself, reappeared at 221
Avenue A, just as the old lady and her grandchild were
sitting down to eat that last half-loaf, with gloomy faces
and all too vigorous appetites.</p>

<p>When Ephraim tapped at the rickety door and Sophy
opened it, to see him standing there with the lost bundle
of blue denim on his shoulders, she screamed with
delight and, catching his hand, dragged him within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why hold on, there, Sissy! I just come to
fetch this back, that was forgot, and to say in the name
of Madam Dalrymple, my &#8216;Little Captain&#8217;s&#8217; present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
guardeen, as how she&#8217;d be glad to make good for that
accident of Buster&#8217;s and the succeeding troubles, and to
fetch this here little dress of Miss Jessica&#8217;s that she
promised Sissy, yonder. Mrs. Trent made it with
her own hands and my &#8216;Captain&#8217; wore it a Christmas
Day.&#8221;</p>

<p>With considerable reluctance, Ephraim was unrolling
the little parcel and displaying the charming contents.
As he did so he could not refrain from one glance at
poor Sophy&#8217;s misshapen back and his wonderment as to
the garment&#8217;s fit. It actually grieved him to think of
anything the beloved mistress of Sobrante had handled
being bestowed in this dingy abode where even he could
detect and shudder at the &#8220;poor smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor was he at all prepared for the ready hospitality
of the old grandmother, who, while her grandchild was
rapturously fondling and examining the gift, all unconscious
of the disparaging look the sharpshooter had
given her, quietly pushed Sophy&#8217;s chair back to the bare
table and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just eating our suppers, Mr.&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marsh, ma&#8217;am, Ephraim Marsh, once of Californy,
late of New York, and originally hailing from Concord,
in the good old State of New Hampshire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pronounced it &#8220;Cawnco&#8217;d,&#8221; and he gave to his
r&#8217;s the peculiar pronunciation which appealed to Granny
Briggs&#8217;s old heart as his offer of money had not done.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Marsh?</i> Of <i>Concord</i>? Why, bless you, man, I was
born there! I myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t! well, gosh all hemlocks! If I ain&#8217;t gladder&#8217;n
I would be to be struck by lightning and pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
much on the same order of things. A girl from
Cawnco&#8217;d! Shake. Name, please, as it is and as it
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Briggs now, Badger it was. My father was the
village shoemaker and cobbler when the town was young
and small,&#8221; cried the thin old lady, her voice vibrant with
unexpected delight, and so joyously altered in appearance
that Sophy ceased staring at her new frock and stared
at her grandmother instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well! I haven&#8217;t a word to say; except
that it&#8217;s just as my good mistress, Gabriella Trent says,
<i>the Lord does lead</i>. To think of it! Just to think of the
strangeness of it for one single minute! Your father
was the shoemaker that my father, the tanner, sold his
skins to! Well-tanned hides they were, too, <i>same as
my own</i>! Tanned so well and so often that I got a
little tired of the business and lit out &#8217;fore I was more&#8217;n
half grown. Sophia Badger! Well, then, I reckon I
<i>will</i> stay and take a bite with you, just for the sake of
old times; only, I guess, by the look of things you haven&#8217;t
been used to men-folk&#8217;s appetites, lately. I saw a real
decent-looking grocery store as I came by. I&#8217;ll step
down and pick up a few odds and ends, if you&#8217;ll let me.
I&#8217;ve been doing the cooking myself, lately, for the oddest
family I ever struck and &#8217;twould be an agreeable
change to eat somebody else&#8217;s truck for once. More&#8217;n
that, there never was a New Hampshire woman that
couldn&#8217;t cook to beat the world. How&#8217;s a rasher of
bacon with eggs, potato chips, and a prime cup of coffee?
If I fetch &#8217;em will you cook them, Sophy Badger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I not?&#8221; cried the now happy old woman, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
whit ashamed to take charity from such as hailed from
Concord&mdash;magic word! In a moment &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
had disappeared, the bundle of work had been recklessly
tossed into a corner, the oil-stove had been lighted,
Sophy dispatched to a neighbor&#8217;s to borrow some needed
dishes and frying pans, and the whole atmosphere
changed to that of a sunny room in a well furnished
home. Even the &#8220;poor smell&#8221; vanished when the sizzling
bacon sent up its own appetizing odors and Granny
set the window wide to let in the evening air. With
that sunset breeze came, also, something which these two
had long needed and sadly; and that was&mdash;happiness.</p>

<p>Blessed Buster! Whose careless speed had brought
it all about! Such a supper as that Sophy Nestor could
not remember. There was neither stint nor caution about
it, and though her elders&#8217; soon satisfied their own appetites,
finding in their reminiscences a more delightful
mental food, the girl ate on and on, and when she could
do no more was not even bidden to take care of what was
left against the morrow&#8217;s breakfast.</p>

<p>But at last the feast was over. &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; resolutely
rose and tore himself away. He had remembered
with compunction that not only the older people in Washington
Square would also need their supper but that Jessica
would, too. So even this old friendship could not
interfere with his love for his &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; whose
history he had given, with all the tender embellishments
his fond fancy pictured. Till even the world-soured old
Granny began to think the girl whom Sophy had called
an &#8220;angel&#8221; must be such, in truth; and left alone with
her grandchild, clasping the twenty-five good dollars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
which Madam had sent, with the offer of more if this
should not be satisfactory, the poor soul burst into tears
and expressions of affection. This almost frightened
Sophy, to whom such demonstrations were new, and she
was glad when she was bidden:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to bed now, child, and dream of the good luck
has come to us this day! And to-morrow I&#8217;ll write my
duty on a decent sheet of paper and you shall carry it
to that old Madam with a nice bunch of daffies&mdash;not too
stale nor faded. Go to bed, but&mdash;you may kiss me first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back hurried Ephraim to that so different home in
Washington Square; and for once regardless of the
etiquette he now so faithfully tried to practice burst into
Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s presence, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;That does beat all my first wife&#8217;s relations, as Aunt
Sally Benton would say. That little hunchback&#8217;s
grandmother is no real pauper as we thought. She&#8217;s just a
bit down on her luck and as nice as lives. Why, woman
alive, <i>she hails from Cawnco&#8217;d</i>! Think of that!
We were both little tackers together in that blessed old
town and my father used to sell her father shoe-leather!
Hooray, &#8216;Little Captain!&#8217; That was a lucky strike Buster
made, when he hit Sophy Nestor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Jessica looked up disturbed at this unwonted behavior
on her &#8220;man&#8217;s&#8221; part, knowing full well how
greatly Cousin Margaret would disapprove, but the expression
of that great dame&#8217;s countenance was worth a
study.</p>

<p>After a moment of amused silence, said she:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! How remarkable! But, Ephraim, if you
please, spare us any more rhapsodies on the Avenue A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
residents. Jessica was bad enough but&mdash;Ephraim, I
would like my dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, the old man saluted, wheeled with his
accustomed military precision and vanished below stairs.
But he felt as if he had been dashed with icy water, while
Jessica in sympathy found tears spring to her eyes. But,
Jessie, alas! did not as yet realize her full privilege in
being a Waldron.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>MORNING TALKS AND INTERRUPTIONS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Cousin Margaret</span>, are there many Avenue A&#8217;s in
this city?&#8221; asked Jessica one morning, shortly after that
first glimpse of real poverty which her visit to Sophy
Nestor had given her.</p>

<p>Madam laid down the Review she was reading&mdash;a
Review of Paris fashions&mdash;and brought her attention to
bear upon the girl sitting thoughtfully upon that old,
fascinating carpet, whose half-invisible figures she was
so fond of studying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not! I should say that one was amply sufficient
for even so large a city as New York. But, Jessica,
do get up and take a chair. You are rumpling your
frock and I shall want you to go down town with me
very soon. I have already ordered the carriage. You
will need many more things and so shall I. Look,
child. You have fairly good taste. What do you think
of this design for a dinner gown? It strikes me as very
graceful, with the long lines and its dignified simplicity.
I&#8217;ve a mind to order Melanie to make me one just
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica obediently came and stood beside the lady, and
tried to fix her gaze upon the colored page of models.
But they seemed to dance before her in a maze of ragged
garments fluttering from a &#8220;pulley&#8221; clothes-line, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the simpering faces of the pictured wearers took on the
haggard features of the wretched tenement women she
could not forget.</p>

<p>&#8220;They all look so silly, those paper women, Cousin
Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, odd child! The editor could scarcely afford
to pay real artists to put on the heads to his fashion-models
after the great expense of them, alone. This is
the most exclusive of our magazines, devoted to the art
of dress, and the styles in this are copyrighted. That&#8217;s
such a fine thing about them, they can never become common.
But&mdash;why do you look at me so strangely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I, Cousin Margaret? Beg pardon, if I was rude.
I didn&#8217;t mean it. I was just&mdash;just thinking about that
buying me more clothes. Why must I have them? Do
you think my mother would like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite likely not. She seems to have taken up very
peculiar ideas, out there in that wilderness. But you
happen to be living in civilization now and must be
clothed in accordance with its demands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica laughed. It always amused her to hear dear
Sobrante spoken of as &#8220;that wilderness,&#8221; when her own
memory of it was so delightful. And it was a little
strange, had either of these two thought about it, that so
old a person as Madam should fall into the habit of consulting
so young an one as &#8220;Little Captain.&#8221; But the
lady had lived so long alone with servants only that it
was a relief to discuss affairs with a real &#8220;gentlewoman&#8221;
and a Waldron, even a girlish one. She had already
learned to look into Jessica&#8217;s eyes, as into a mirror, for
approval or disapproval of her oft-changed attire; and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
when it was what her own conscience warned her was
&#8220;too youthful,&#8221; to meet a disappointed expression in the
big, blue eyes. They were so clear and far-seeing, with
such instant perception of the false or the true, that
Cousin Margaret trusted them in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, girlie, what do you think? Would I look well
in such a gown?&#8221; again rather impatiently demanded the
Madam.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you would look beautiful, just beautiful. You
always do, dear Cousin. Next to my mother I think you
must be the most handsome lady lives. I&#8217;ve seen nobody
here in this New York, in the carriages we meet in the
Park, nor in the stores down town&mdash;or up town, either&mdash;that
can compare with you. I suppose that&#8217;s because
you are a Waldron. And so&mdash;Do you mind if I say it
right out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether I do or not you are pretty sure to &#8216;say out&#8217;
whatever is in your mind. So do it now,&#8221; smilingly
answered the other, flattered more than she acknowledged
by this sincere admiration of Jessica.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I wish you wouldn&#8217;t spend any more
money on pretty clothes. I wish you&#8217;d give it to the
Avenue A people, and all the others like them in this
great city. O Cousin Margaret! It just makes my heart
ache so I can&#8217;t sleep, some nights, thinking they have no
soft beds like ours to lie on and so few poor rags to
wear while you, while I, have more things than we need.
My mother thought three frocks were all I wanted. Two
to change and a fresh one for Sunday. Only, of course,
at Christmas time it is well to have a prettier one because
that is the best day in all the year and one should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
do it reverence. It would save you so much worry, too,
and you wouldn&#8217;t get half so tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Who ever said that I was tired? Not I,
indeed, and who spoke of worry? Oh! that unfortunate
accident of Buster&#8217;s! I&#8217;d rather have given a thousand
dollars than have it happen. Your head has been
full of maggots&mdash;I mean of unwholesomely grave ideas&mdash;ever
since. I think that Ephraim fosters them, too,
and much as I should dislike to separate you two I fear
I shall have to do it, unless you both promise to put this
Avenue A business out of mind and take life as you
should, in your own station. Tired? I&#8217;m certain you
never heard me complain, little Jessica Trent, nor anybody
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cousin Margaret, and that&#8217;s what makes Barnes
and me feel so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho! So Barnes is in it, too, is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. It&#8217;s she helps undress you and puts
away your clothes and she says the wardrobes and closets
are just packed with them. She says it&#8217;s a great worriment
to her to keep the moths and bugs out of &#8217;em. She
says it would be worse, only you like silk things best and
moths don&#8217;t much trouble the silks. She&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, let me explain what mostly &#8216;worries&#8217; our
good soul Barnes. As lady&#8217;s-maid her perquisites are
my cast-off clothing. This she sells for a considerable
sum and puts the proceeds in the bank. So I shouldn&#8217;t
think she would object to my buying as many new things
as possible. Humph! If Barnes has got to betraying
bedroom secrets Barnes must be dealt with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madam Dalrymple leaned back in her chair, tossed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the Review aside, and tapped with her tiny cane upon
the floor. This cane she called her &#8220;affectation,&#8221; laughingly
declaring that she carried it because it happened to
be a fad of fashionable folk just then, and only the old
maid servant knew how sorely it was really needed for
support. At that very moment, indeed, it was almost
impossible for the proud woman to prevent the contortion
of her handsome features by a spasm of pain.
Rheumatism held her in thrall, but still she laughed and
defied it; believing that no Waldron should be overcome
by anything so plebeian as physical distress. She would
carry herself proudly to the end and when that came, let
it come quickly!</p>

<p>Barnes appeared and was bidden to bring hat and
mantle; and in a few moments more the Dalrymple carriage
was whirling storeward, its mistress and her young
western cousin making such a lovely picture against its
dark cushions that more than one person looked and envied.
Not the least of these a small flower-girl, clad in
a rather soiled white-and-scarlet frock, who hid her misshapen
shoulders against a building and wistfully held
up her violets for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five cents a bunch, lady! Only&mdash;five&mdash;centses&mdash;a
bunch!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something familiar in the shrill cry caught Jessica&#8217;s
ear, but the carriage had turned into Broadway and it
was too late to see if that were Sophy Nestor who had
called her wares.</p>

<p>Greatly to Jessica&#8217;s grief the two girls had not met
since that day of their brief acquaintance. Sophy had
duly taken her stand in the Square and there had watched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and waited for a glimpse of the fair-haired &#8220;angel&#8221; who
had brightened a few hours of her life. But it was
Madam Dalrymple, not Jessica, who discovered the girl
posted as near her own iron gates as could be without
entering them and who had promptly dispatched Tipkins
to interview the Square patrolman on the subject. Result:
Sophy was banished as a &#8220;nuisance&#8221;; and, vowing
vengeance against everybody who had interfered with
her, established herself on the very next corner beyond
this policeman&#8217;s beat. Thence she gibed at and mocked
him, with all her gutter eloquence, matching her puny
strength against his authority and affecting him not at
all, save that he became much interested in the defiant
little creature and pitying her for her physical affliction,
marveled at the peculiarities of the rich who could call
such as she a &#8220;nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>There, alas! She had waited and watched in vain for
her new friend. It so chanced that for the first time in
her life the little Californian fell ill of a slight cold, which
Madam instantly magnified into something dreadful; suggesting
diphtheria, and other dire diseases, to the portly
physician who came in his carriage and looked the small
maid over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing in the world but a mere cold, dear Madam.
There&#8217;s not the least cause for anxiety. Keep her indoors
for a time and she&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221; Then he departed,
pocketing his goodly fee, and leaving his old patron of
exactly the same opinion she had held all along.</p>

<p>So it was small wonder that on this morning of the
shopping trip Jessica should look almost as wan as would
have been suitable had she been really ill. The confinement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
in that poorly ventilated mansion had told upon her
who had lived always out of doors, and it had given her
time to think much about that other half of the world
which dwelt in Avenue A.</p>

<p>Seeing her at last, stirred Sophy Nestor&#8217;s heart to
its depths. Her &#8220;angel&#8221; didn&#8217;t look happy. Sophy
wasn&#8217;t happy, herself. Granny Briggs was even more
gloomy than of old. The visit of Ephraim had delighted
her for the time; but when it was repeated and he had
urged her removal to better quarters she had stubbornly
refused. It had suddenly come to her New England
pride that she was becoming an object of charity and she
would not be pauperized, even by an old town-mate
whose father had sold her father shoe-leather.</p>

<p>She went even further. She sent Sophy to the Square
with the twenty-five dollars in crisp new bills, carefully
folded within that cheap scrap of letter paper, whereon
she had inscribed her &#8220;duty&#8221; and her thanks, along with
the statement that as no injury had been done no payment
was necessary. The frock bestowed upon her
grandchild she could not return. That had already been
assumed and worn to bed&mdash;lest by some mischance it
should disappear&mdash;a vision too beautiful to be real.</p>

<p>In vain Ephraim argued, scolded, entreated. He was
obliged to carry the money back, for Madam Dalrymple
refused to touch it, regarding it as already infected by
the &#8220;poor smell&#8221; or some foul disease. And when his
entreaties were useless, he quietly disposed the sum in
a safe place, awaiting some future day when he could
spend it for his old friend, he angrily declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you, Sophia Badger Briggs, is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
you over-ate yourself that night. You&#8217;ve been indulgin&#8217;
your stomach with poor rations and slop victuals and
that one good square meal just gave you the dyspepsy.
Nothing else on earth ails you. A man with the dyspepsy&mdash;or
a woman either&mdash;ain&#8217;t in their right mind.
They haven&#8217;t got a correct &#8216;sight&#8217; and can&#8217;t shoot
straight. You think you&#8217;ve hit the &#8216;bull&#8217;s-eye&#8217; with this
cantankerous pride o&#8217; yours but you haven&#8217;t come within
a mile of it. However, &#8216;When she will she will, you
may depend on&#8217;t, and when she won&#8217;t she won&#8217;t, and
there&#8217;s an end on&#8217;t.&#8217; So I&#8217;ll take myself back to my pots
and pans and when you want me or my help just send
that bright little girl of yours after me an&#8217; I&#8217;ll keep step
to the music, instanter. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it seemed that Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s anxiety over
the Avenue A acquaintance was useless. &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
and Jessica did, indeed, often discuss it, but the
matter ended in discussion merely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only, Ephy dear, I can never, never be just the
same girl I was before I went to that dreadful place.
It&#8217;s made this &#8216;being one of the richest,&#8217; as I shall be,
seem such a solemn thing. The money that will be mine
sometime must all be used to help such poor folks. It
won&#8217;t be <i>mine</i>, really, you know. My mother said that.
She said it would be &#8216;a trust put into my hands for righteous
disposal.&#8217; Those were her very own words. Course,
I haven&#8217;t the money yet. The mine is costing more than
it pays out, now at first, but it&#8217;s coming. Mr. Ninian
said there was no possibility of mistake. When it does&mdash;O
Ephy! It frightens me to think I may not give
enough or give it right or, in some way, be unfaithful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
to that &#8216;trust.&#8217; It makes me feel so old, so old, Ephy
dear!&#8221; cried the hitherto careless girl, with an earnestness
which touched and offended her old henchman, till
he agreed with Madam Dalrymple that he&#8217;d &#8220;give a
thousand dollars if that accident had never happened.&#8221;
&#8220;Only,&#8221; he added whimsically, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the thousand,
so it&#8217;s easy to boast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One good thing there is. Mr. Hale called here yesterday,
to see me&mdash;to see <i>me</i>, Ephraim Marsh! Think of
that! He came to tell me what my mother had arranged
about my &#8216;spending-money.&#8217; It seemed to be so queer,
this being an &#8216;heiress&#8217; yet never having any money of
my own to use. Having to go to Cousin Margaret when
I wanted any and always being afraid to ask. Anyhow,
that&#8217;s all past. I am to have an allowance of five dollars
a month spending-money. All for myself. Isn&#8217;t that
splendid? Mr. Hale says my mother wishes me to learn
the proper use of that amount and as I grow older and
require more it shall be furnished. As if any girl could
possibly want more than that! Isn&#8217;t it fine? Isn&#8217;t it?
Do say so, &#8216;Forty-niner,&#8217; or I shall be so disappointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Land, honey! I&#8217;d say anything in the dictionary to
prevent that. I only want to give you a bit of advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Ephy! Don&#8217;t give it! I&#8217;ve never had so much
advice given me in all my life as since I&#8217;ve come to this
New York. Just keep it to yourself, old dear!&#8221; cried
Jessica, laying her hand upon his lips.</p>

<p>Whence he removed it with a laugh, but stubbornly
insisting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I must. Just one word. Don&#8217;t waste a cent of
that sixty dollars per annum on anybody living at 221<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Avenue A, rear tenement, top floor. Flambergasted proud
old thing! Even the little one&#8217;s caught the distemper and
actually turned up her little pug nose at a peppermint
cat I bought for her, t&#8217;other day. Fact. Yet the little
beggar looked at it so greedy&mdash;Whew! Her eyes were
as green as the cat&#8217;s own! But touch it, no! &#8216;I don&#8217;t
care for pep&#8217;mints,&#8217; quoth she. &#8216;I mean my Granny
don&#8217;t care to have me eat &#8217;em.&#8217; I bet all my old shoes
they hadn&#8217;t a mouthful in that cupboard that minute,
and old Sophia sewing as if she hadn&#8217;t another minute
to live and must get everything done in that one. A
cupboard full of pride, they had. Nothing else.
Shucks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t sneer at them, Mr. Ephraim Marsh. I
like them for it. I used to think pride was sinful. But
it isn&#8217;t. Look at my Cousin Margaret. Instead of complaining
and groaning, like Wun Lung, when he has
a pain, she bottles all hers up in her own breast and
spares everybody the thought of her suffering. Barnes
says nobody knows what &#8216;my lady&#8217; endures, some of
those &#8216;privacy&#8217; times, when she&#8217;s shut up in her bedroom
and never lets on. Then, when she gets a little better,
on she puts her prettiest gown and down she comes smiling
and sits at table as easy as if she had never ached at
all. I think that&#8217;s fine, Ephy. I think that&#8217;s the best
part of being a &#8216;Waldron,&#8217; or any other high-up person,
that one is too proud ever to &#8216;let on&#8217; and make other
folks unhappy. There&#8217;s so many ways of testing a gentleperson;
like Cousin Margaret offering a stranger caller
a rocking chair. She keeps one on purpose, though she
wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;demean&#8217; to sit in it herself. If the stranger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
takes it and rocks, that&#8217;s the end of the stranger for my
Cousin Margaret, for it proves the stranger ill-bred.
It&#8217;s always rude to rock in company, Ephraim, remember
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well! There&#8217;s a lot of nonsense been
stuffed into your curly head since we struck the trail for
this Gotham! Along with some sense, too. But, my
&#8216;Captain,&#8217; don&#8217;t you go and get a solemn-ite! I couldn&#8217;t
stand that. The minute you get too good to be wholesome
I shall upstakes and hoof it back to Californy.
And, speakin&#8217; of Madam, she&#8217;s begun to pay me reg&#8217;lar
wages, same as she would any other &#8216;chef,&#8217; as she calls
it. So betwixt your allowance and my wages&mdash;we ought
to feed a good many hungry folks in the course of a
year. Eh! What? Who&#8217;s ringing that bell that way?
sounds like the crack of doom; and I vow, I believe
they&#8217;ve smashed it! Tipkins is out, Barnes has got
the sick headache, no &#8216;emergency&#8217; creatur&#8217; in for the
day, I&#8217;ll have to answer it myself. Hope to goodness
there hasn&#8217;t anything happened!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there had. The direst happening which could befall
that ancient mansion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


<small>&#8220;LAYLOCKS.&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> this same morning Sophy Nestor was early at her
post, with her mended tray filled with the second-hand
bouquets she bought from the florists or market-gardeners.
Second-hand in the sense that they had already
been long gathered and were on the point of withering.
But flowers in a city cost much money&mdash;much, that is,
for a fund so small as Sophy&#8217;s, and fresh ones were
wholly beyond her means.</p>

<p>So she shrewdly disposed her posies on her wicker
tray, putting the best blossom forward, freshening them
by sprinkling at a convenient drinking-fountain, and losing
no sales for want of insistence on her own part.
Many bought from her because it was the easiest way to
be rid of her petitions, others because they pitied her
misfortune; and still more because she had a deft, tasteful
way of arranging her wares which tempted all flower-lovers.
So, in ordinary, she managed each day to sell
all her stock; and this morning, in especial, she hoped for
a brisk trade because&mdash;Well, because she was going to
be guilty of an extravagance which seemed almost like
stealing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This very sweetest, freshest branch of laylock is
for my Jessica Trent, if she goes ridin&#8217; by this way. The
market-woman throwed it in free for nothin&#8217;, &#8217;cause she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
said maybe &#8217;twould bring me good luck. Seems if I
might take it and give it, if I want, since I didn&#8217;t have
to pay for it. I always think the flowers belong to
Granny and I mustn&#8217;t give away none, bad&#8217;s I want.
But, to-day, if she <i>should</i> go a-ridin&#8217; by again&mdash;Oh! <i>if
she should!</i> I&#8217;m going to hop right up into the middle
of the street, straight again&#8217; them horses&#8217; feet, and I&#8217;ll
yell loud enough this time to make her hear and look.
If she looks she&#8217;ll smile, sure; and she&#8217;ll stop if that
old White Hair &#8217;ll let her. Then I&#8217;ll fling the laylock
square into her lap, as she sets there a-ridin&#8217; on them
cushions. Oh! my!&#8221; murmured Sophy to herself, wanting
another listener.</p>

<p>But the Dalrymple carriage did not appear. Madame
was in &#8220;privacy&#8221; just then; which might mean that she
was in suffering or under the hands of that person who
seemed so mysterious to Jessica&mdash;a professional hair-dresser.
As Ephraim had said, Barnes had also retired
with her sick headache, and Tipkins had gone marketing.</p>

<p>To waiting, watching, hoping little Sophy the big mansion
looked strangely quiet and deserted; and the hours
dragged by without her having courage even to molest
a passer-by with her shrill;</p>

<p>&#8220;Posies! Only five centses a bunch? Please buy my
posies!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like the little maid behind those barricading iron lions,
at that very moment speculating on the realities of life,
Sophy herself fell pondering; and inquired of a vagrant
cur who timidly approached:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, doggie, what makes us all so different? I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
asked Granny and all she says is, &#8216;Injustice.&#8217; I don&#8217;t
know what that means. I don&#8217;t know why Jessica Trent
wears all the time a soft white dress and I&mdash;Well, I
wear this one, too, now, only it isn&#8217;t quite so white as
it was. But I dassent take it off to let Granny wash it,
&#8217;cause she says it&#8217;s none too big now an&#8217; &#8217;twould pucker
and shrink all up, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s wool. Why does she live
in that big house and I in Aveny A? What makes her
folks so rich and mine so poor? Hey, doggie? Yes,
you may smell o&#8217; my posies. Smellin&#8217; &#8217;em won&#8217;t hurt
any. I wish&mdash;Oh! I wish she would come right out that
door and walk up to me and say: &#8216;Why, Sophy! How
glad I am to see you!&#8217; That&#8217;s the way I believe she&#8217;d
talk if she was let. If that White Hair&mdash;Whew, doggie!
What&#8217;s that I smell? &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t them posies. It&#8217;s
more like smoke somewheres. Never mind. I guess
that carriage isn&#8217;t a-ridin&#8217; out to-day, so I&#8217;ll just go close
up to them iron gates and watch closer. If she should
happen to come to the door to look out&mdash;If she should
happen!&mdash;Why then I&#8217;d be right on hand and ready, and
I&#8217;d fire that laylock bunch clean into the doorway and
the hall, lickety-cut! Come on! Who&#8217;s afraid? That
old policeman is out of sight, anyway, and besides I
don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s half so mad as he pretended. I&#8217;ll walk
right straight along as bold as&mdash;as one them lions and&mdash;Queer!
Where <i>is</i> that smell of smoke. Oh! I hope
it isn&#8217;t 221 Aveny A! But, course, it can&#8217;t be. That&#8217;s
too far off to smell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping a wary eye for the return of the policeman,
Sophy assumed as nonchalant an air as possible and
sauntered slowly up to the closed gates of the great, old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
mansion, and there forcing her up-tilted nose
between the bars resumed her anxious watch. But only
for a moment longer. Then the awful truth burst on
the startled child, wise in city lore; and, with an agility
unlooked for in her poor body, she leaped the closed gates
and pulled at the bell. Forgotten now was the precious
&#8220;laylock,&#8221; already wilting on the hot sidewalk, forgotten
fear of the policeman and of that more formidable
White Hair&mdash;Ring, ring, ring!</p>

<p>When Ephraim rushed to answer that frenzied appeal,
still clinging to the handle of the old-fashioned bell Sophy
fell headlong at his feet; but was up and dashing onward
again with the mad cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;This house is afire! This house is burnin&#8217; up!
Where&#8217;s Jessica Trent? O Jessica, Jessica, <i>Jes-si-ca</i>!!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; was in the garden.
It was the most attractive spot to her in that establishment,
and she, with Ephraim&#8217;s help, had already
reduced some of its disorder to a semblance of neatness.
Now, as if guided by instinct, Sophy made her way
thither, still screaming her warning cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;The house is afire! Where are you, Jessica Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>An instant later she had her arms about her &#8220;angel&#8221;
as if to protect that beloved one at the risk of her own
life. Already, other voices than hers had taken up her
cry of &#8220;fire!&#8221; than which there is none more terrifying,
and already the door which had been opened to her had
admitted many more.</p>

<p>Uproar followed. Clanging engines filled that side of
the square. Firemen spread themselves throughout the
house, already doomed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>&#8220;Must have been burning a long time. Why, this
upper floor is but a shell, already!&#8221; cried one, and began
to pound on the unopened doors to learn if anybody was
within the great, shut chambers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam? yes, she&#8217;s somewhere on this second floor.
The front room,&#8221; stammered Ephraim, too bewildered to
be of much use; and for the first time in his life, since
he had known her, utterly forgetting his &#8220;Little Captain.&#8221;
Even had he remembered her he would not have feared,
knowing her activity and common sense. To get away,
out of the endangered structure, would have been Jessica&#8217;s
natural impulse.</p>

<p>Then a man in a helmet came out of the &#8220;privacy&#8221;
so rudely invaded, bringing in his arms a frail, slender
old woman, pale as death and almost as unconscious.
After her came, shrieking down from a higher floor, poor
Barnes; herself in unseemly deshabille and announcing
to everybody:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault! It&#8217;s all my fault! I was cleaning&mdash;a
gown&mdash;benzine&mdash;a candle&mdash;Oh! what have I done,
what have I done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Destroyed one of the city&#8217;s priceless landmarks, you
old fool, you!&#8221; roughly returned a struggling fireman,
whose labor she interrupted. &#8220;Get down those stairs&mdash;never
mind the flames&mdash;they&#8217;ll hold you yet, if you go
now. Get out&mdash;<i>instantly</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnes went. More nimbly than she would have
dreamed possible and followed where she saw her mistress
was being carried, into the nearest drug store amid
a crowd of curious strangers. There beside the dazed,
half-comprehending Madam she flung herself to earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and bewailed the day that ever she was born; till,
suddenly recovering from her own confusion, Mrs. Dalrymple
said sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnes, get up. Cover my head with the corner of
this blanket and&mdash;and behave yourself. It&#8217;s not your
house is burning. You are not a Waldron!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s my fault. I done it. Cleaning that lavender
silk, to sell it for a better price. Oh! what shall
I do, what shall I do! How can I see it burn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? Repent in dust and ashes and never let me see
your face again!&#8221; cried the tortured Madam, who felt
as if the hearts of all her ancestors were being consumed
in that blazing pile, where so many Waldrons
had lived and died and which she had not left, even on
her own marriage.</p>

<p>Barnes crept away; nor was it known that ever afterward
she did present herself before the mistress she had
served for half a century.</p>

<p>There was no saving anything. From the beginning
the old house, that was what the firemen called a &#8220;tinder
box,&#8221; burned swiftly; and when Tipkins came back
from market, with his well-filled basket on his arm, he
found but a heap of smoldering ruins where had been his
lifelong home. It seemed to the faithful old man that
his heart broke then and there. But was ever a broken
heart known to interfere with what an English butler
considered his &#8220;duty?&#8221; In a moment he had found his
mistress and stood before her awaiting her orders, almost
as quietly as if it had been the giving of a dinner
order, merely. There was none of the frantic remorse
of poor Barnes and his quietude helped Madam infinitely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
though now, to outward appearance, she, too, was calm
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Tipkins, we must get under shelter at once.
Find Jessica, order a carriage&mdash;I don&#8217;t suppose our own
is available&mdash;and take me to the Fifth Avenue hotel.
Ask the druggist, please, if he has a private room where
I can remain until the hack arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room was found, and the lady conveyed thither;
but when Jessica was sought she was not to be discovered.
The knowledge of this came to &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; first by
Tipkins saying, in his most impassive voice yet with
quivering lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just speak to your little lady, Marsh, and tell her the
Madam is waiting. We&#8217;re to go to a hotel for the present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Who? What?&#8221; demanded Ephraim, still standing
a bit apart from the waning crowd, with arms folded
and gaze fixed contemplatively upon the smoking walls.
&#8220;What a pity! What a horrible pity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t mention it, not yet, please, man. Tell
Miss Jessica, right away. I must get Madam to her
shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jes-si-ca! My &#8216;Little Captain,&#8217; you mean? Man
alive, isn&#8217;t she with Madam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She hasn&#8217;t seen her, I fancy. Leastwise, she
bade me find the child and fetch her. Hurry up. Madam
Dalrymple isn&#8217;t one to mix with a crowd like this, even
under such circumstances. Hurry, now. I&#8217;m signalling
that hack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim&#8217;s weather-beaten face went ghastly white.
For a moment his senses whirled. The next he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
rushing madly into the very midst of the heated ruins,
shrieking like one bereft:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessica! Jessica! &#8216;Little Captain!&#8217; Where are you?
Oh! where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Strong hands forced him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man have you lost your wits? Are you seeking
death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be&mdash;in a minute&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;Oh! Has anybody,
anybody, seen a little girl? A golden&mdash;haired, curly-headed
little girl with the face of an angel? Has anybody&mdash;seen&mdash;my
&#8216;Lady Jess&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it calm, old man. Tell it again. A little girl?
Is there a child missing? Was there a little girl in that
old house? and where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! yes, yes! There was&mdash;there is&mdash;there must be!
<i>Where?</i> How can I tell? We&mdash;we were sitting&mdash;talking&mdash;just
as if&mdash;as if&mdash;Oh! my God! as if there was
never any danger in the world, when that bell rang and
that other child, that hump-backed flower one&mdash;Oh!
Jessica, Jessica!&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke from his captors with the strength of frenzy
and would have dashed headlong again to his own ruin,
over that heap of flame and broken foundations, but again
more hands and stronger held him back. Then somebody
found voice to break again into that pregnant silence
with the suggestion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Try the rear! The alley way! The stables! They
haven&#8217;t gone yet&mdash;We may find&mdash;&#8221; But even that
would-be hopeful voice did not say what they might
find.</p>

<p>To the rear they rushed, where an engine and hose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
carriage still blocked the way, playing upon the scorched
but yet standing stables, whence some thoughtful man
had already led the blindfolded, frightened horses. Past
these rushed Ephraim, a dozen at his heels. Through the
singed alley gate into that ruined garden where the fallen
beams and timbers lay thick and smoking.</p>

<p>Then peering frantically here and there, hopefully remembering
now how fond his darling had been of that
neglected spot, &#8220;our only bit of outdoors&#8221; here in this
great city, Ephraim came at last upon a point whence
gleamed something white and soft. But the white gleam
was a motionless one, and tottering like a man in a palsy
the old sharpshooter raised his shaking hand and pointed
toward that distant corner, then covered his eyes with his
trembling arm.</p>

<p>Reverently, those grimed firemen lifted the scorched
bush from what lay beneath. By the irony of fate it was
a &#8220;laylock,&#8221; and had once borne blossoms such as Sophy
had that morning cherished. It was she they found first.
She was lying with outspread arms, prone on the larger,
stronger body of Jessica beneath, as if stretching her
own limbs to the utmost, that they might wholly cover
the other girl she adored. She had evidently forced the
&#8220;Little Captain&#8221; downward, and, with the instinct
of love, broken many branches from everywhere about
and heaped them first on the other child. Then she had
thrown herself upon these branches and so awaited&mdash;What?</p>

<p>A thought of what those children, that little heroine,
had suffered in their time of terror blanched strong
faces even now; but it was a glad cry that went up:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>&#8220;This one isn&#8217;t dead! She&#8217;s only half-suffocated with
the smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor this! Nor this! This yellow-headed one is opening
her eyes! Thank God! They are alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later the clang of a hospital ambulance
came into that alley, whence the engine had swiftly been
removed, and upon a stretcher therein were most tenderly
placed the two small forms of the rescued children,
then&mdash;Clang! and away again.</p>

<p>But there stood on the step in the rear a bareheaded,
wild old man who would not be gainsaid, whose eyes
were blind with tears, and whose constant moan was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my &#8216;Little Captain!&#8217; &#8216;Little Captain!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a rear room of a plebeian drug store
a haughty, astonished old lady sat and ignominiously
waited; enduring as best she could the peeps and stares
of the &#8220;common&#8221; people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<small>LEARNING LIFE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessica</span> opened her eyes from a strangely pleasant
dream. Angels had been hovering around her, as it
seemed; but, oddly enough, they had not worn the traditional
feathers and wings. Some of them were all in
white, with white caps on their heads, and some were
clad in blue like the sky from which they must have
come. Presently, one of the white angels bade a blue
one:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold that cup to her lips. She is reviving.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the cup was held, &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; obediently
drank its contents, which proved to be something warm
and soothing. Then she drifted away again into a sleep
that was dreamless, this time; and from which she again
awoke to realize completely what had happened and in
what sort of place she was.</p>

<p>The &#8220;white angel&#8221; was a &#8220;head-nurse.&#8221; The blue
one an undergraduate. She recognized the hospital uniforms
from those she had seen in Los Angeles, while
Ephraim lay recovering from his broken limb. She was
in the children&#8217;s ward. Rows of white beds lined each
side of the long room, and on each bed rested a child.
On the very next cot to her own, with some doctors and
more nurses fussing about it, was Sophy Nestor. She
heard one of these saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>&#8220;That is quite curable. It would be a most interesting
case. After she recovers from this shock I&#8217;ll investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then that doctor went away and the rest soon followed
him, leaving only a sweet-faced woman in blue hovering
between the two cots, whereon lay these last &#8220;emergency&#8221;
cases. To her Jessica spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Sophy awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is waking. Try not to frighten nor disturb her.
How are you feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I want to get up and go home. Oh! I
forgot! I haven&#8217;t any now, but go to my Cousin Margaret,
wherever she is. She must be somewhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t excite yourself, dear. You shall go soon, for
you&#8217;ve had a wonderful escape. Do you suffer at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some. My hands, my face are smarty and queer.
But&mdash;did Sophy get burned instead? Oh! she was so
good! So strong I couldn&#8217;t make her stop hiding me
with her own self, though I tried and tried. Until it
got so hot and I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t think right. The darling
girl! She&mdash;Why! What makes her lie that way on
her face?&#8221; demanded Jessica, rising on her elbow and
staring across to the other limp little figure whose hump
protruded under the light bed-covering.</p>

<p>The nurse knew it was better to appease one patient&#8217;s
curiosity than to arouse the other, more badly injured
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie still and I will tell you. She is a heroine. Her
back is rather badly scorched and burned, but not fatally
so. It has been carefully dressed and it is more comfortable
for her to rest as she is doing now than to lie in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
a more natural position. She was a brave little creature
and, practically, saved your life. Try to help her get
well by keeping very quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>In ordinary, Jessica was not a crying girl, but the
tears chased themselves now down her own cheeks, white
with applications to relieve that &#8220;smarting&#8221; to which she
had acknowledged but that already, in view of Sophy&#8217;s
greater hurt, seemed absurdly trivial.</p>

<p>Nor did the wise attendant try to stop this flood, a
sure relief to startled nerves and grieving heart. But
after a brief time Jessica ceased weeping and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where my folks are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an old man in the waiting-room who came
with you. He is almost wild with anxiety and, if the
head-nurse allows, I will bring him in to see you for a
moment. On condition that you will not excite yourself
nor the other child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I will be as quiet as quiet! It&#8217;s Ephy! I&#8217;m
sure it&#8217;s my darling &#8216;Forty-niner!&#8217; Fetch him, please,
right quick! I&#8217;ll be as good as you want, only let him
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came, half-blinded by his grateful tears, as he
bent above this darling of his old age, too thankful toward
Heaven for speech, and only able to clasp and unclasp
her small hands in his own trembling ones, till
she asked in a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my Cousin Margaret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t exactly know. Some hotel, Tipkins was
taking her. I&#8217;ll seek her now and tell her the good news.
Oh! my lamb, my lamb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Ephy, dear! Be good. Now go and tell her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
I&#8217;m all right and tell her, too, how splendid Sophy Nestor
was. She covered me with her own self so that I
should not be burned,&mdash;she would rather be herself! Go
tell her, tell her quick! She thought Sophy wasn&#8217;t&mdash;a
Waldron, but, Ephy dear! She is more Waldron-y than
any of us! Go tell her, and come back soon. I guess I
can be &#8216;discharged,&#8217; maybe right away. I&#8217;m not the
hurt one, only Sophy. And I&#8217;ll stay just long enough to
make her feel how splendid a place a hospital really is
and not that dreadful one she used to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, he had to go. He had stayed as long as the
nurse thought wise, but it was a far different old man
who left that house of mercy from him who had entered
it, believing his darling done to death.</p>

<p>By the very next morning Jessica was up and dressed;
her scorched clothing replaced by an outfit Madam had
promptly sent, with the request that the little girl be
taken to her at her hotel as soon as the authorities
deemed it safe. That, they decided, might be almost at
once. The hospital was overcrowded, there was no
room for those who did not really need attention, and
Jessica&#8217;s healthy frame had promptly recovered from the
shock of her frightful experience. There remained only
the bit of talk that was to be allowed between her and
her rescuer. Sitting with her own blistered hands resting
on that part of Sophy&#8217;s body which was least covered
by bandages, Jessica said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go away now, darling, but I shall come
back. You&#8217;re going to get well right soon, the doctors
say, and oh! Sophy, I heard one of them say, too, that
your back could be made as straight as mine! Think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of that! Never to have to be afraid of people looking at
you, never to be weak and tired there, any more! Oh!
aren&#8217;t you glad you came? It isn&#8217;t a real hunchback, you
know; only you were let to fall when you were little
and got twisted somehow. I think it&#8217;s like a fairy story.
Anyhow, it&#8217;s just what my darling mother says: &#8216;Life
is a chain.&#8217; One thing after another form the links of
it and none of them happen except God wills. I don&#8217;t
see why He willed that my Cousin Margaret should lose
her beautiful old home that seemed more to her than
anything in this world. All her pretty clothes and old,
old &#8216;antiques,&#8217; and just had her life saved. Why, it
seems as if all those hunting people on that carpet in the
back drawing-room must have felt the flames and suffered!</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. That&#8217;s past. What she will do next
I don&#8217;t know; only this I&#8217;m sure of, she&#8217;ll let me come to
see you every day; and maybe&mdash;maybe, she&#8217;ll come, too.
Now, I&#8217;m going. Ephraim is here with the carriage and
I must. If you&#8217;d like it better, maybe my Cousin Margaret
will let me pay for having you in a &#8216;private&#8217;
room away from&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no! I don&#8217;t want to be private! I want to
feel there are heaps and slathers of folks all around me,
just as there used to be in Aveny A. I&#8217;d die to be alone
with nobody but them doctors waitin&#8217; to cut me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Sophy Nestor, you quit that! I&#8217;ve told you before
that you didn&#8217;t know a thing about hospitals. I do.
I&#8217;ve lived in one once, away home in California. They&#8217;re
the blessedest places are. Your Granny Briggs is coming
to see you this morning. Ephraim is to fetch her in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
carriage, after he takes me to my old lady first. Isn&#8217;t
that funny? Each of us has our own old lady that we
think is the nicest in the world! Now, I&#8217;m going.
Hear me say! Before you&#8217;ve been in this pleasant place
even another day you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s just as nice as I do.
See if you don&#8217;t. Now, good-by. I can&#8217;t begin to
thank you. Words couldn&#8217;t do it. Maybe deeds can,
and I&#8217;ll try <i>them</i>. Good-by. Try to be happy and you&#8217;ll
get well quick. Good-by, good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica found her Cousin Margaret deep in consultation
with Madam Melanie and that other dressmaker
from the side street. But the Madam instantly ceased
speaking to these waiting modistes, to clasp the girl in
her arms and to hold her close, close. In that one firm
embrace was a world of meaning, from this undemonstrative
old dame. Then she released the child, merely
retaining one small hand in her own, while she continued
her conference concerning the replenishing of the
wardrobes so completely destroyed by fire. Neither she
nor Jessica had anything left save what they had escaped
in; and the simple ready-made suit purchased to leave
the hospital in that morning.</p>

<p>The discussion was short. Both these women who had
charge of Mrs. Dalrymple&#8217;s attire knew readily what she
would require and undertook that part of the order
should be put into the &#8220;hurry&#8221; department, and be
forthcoming almost immediately. That business over,
they departed and the two descendants of the race of
Waldron were left to themselves, the younger of them
scarcely daring to look at the elder, dreading her distress.
She need not have feared, in the least.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8220;Well, my dear, this is unexpected, indeed. But we
are very comfortable here until we can get away out of
town. We will go as soon as possible. As soon as we
have clothes fit to go in. It&#8217;s early for Newport but I
think we&#8217;d better settle there at once. I&#8217;ve been looking
over an agent&#8217;s list of furnished &#8216;cottages&#8217; and fancy one
of them will do. I must send for my man of business
first. I think it rather strange he has not already called
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madam had taken one of the prettiest suites in the
hotel, with its comfortable privacy, and already seemed
so much at home and so outwardly content that Jessica
wondered. Only for a moment, when a servant came to
announce a caller, did a spasm of pain cross the fine
old features, and give a touch of sharpness to the quiet
voice, as she repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already given orders that I can receive no
visitors at present. Kindly see that these orders are attended
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jessica was bidden to relate again the story
Madam had already learned from other lips and the girl
was delighted to hear her kinswoman announce:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make my first call upon that child, Sophy.
We must befriend her. Mr. Hale has been here and
has telegraphed your mother of&mdash;of everything. Now,
my dear, hand me the morning paper; and make your
own self comfortable. If you wish to write to your
mother, there are the materials on that desk in the
corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jessica wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dearest Mother</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am alive. That&#8217;s about the first thing I can think
to say. So is our Cousin Margaret. So is everybody
else. It was all Barnes&#8217;s fault. She said so herself. She
used benzine, that seems to be a catchy sort of stuff, and
a match near it and first she knew the flames were so
big she couldn&#8217;t stop them. She tried. Ephraim told
me. She hasn&#8217;t been near since and never will, but he
saw her on the street outside the hospital where they took
Sophy and me, &#8217;cause she was afraid that her carelessness
had made her a murderer as well as a house-burner.
She said she would have been a murderer if I had died,
or Sophy, but we didn&#8217;t and she isn&#8217;t. I hope I will
never see her again, now, because she would always make
me feel angry for my Cousin Margaret.</p>

<p>&#8220;O mother dear! I think she is the wonderfullest woman
ever could be! I know and you know that she loved
the home in Washington Square beyond words, &#8217;cause
though it was all tumbling to pieces in spots and the
things inside were getting so worn-out, she wouldn&#8217;t sell
it even for heaps and heaps of money. I know her heart
is just broken inside of her but the break doesn&#8217;t show
on the outside, in her face, not the least littlest bit. She
sits just as proud in her old &#8216;comfy&#8217; wrapper as she used
to in her beautifullest silk gown. Once I tried to say
something nice to her, to sort of comfort her if I could,
and she just looked at me so queer. &#8216;My dear, spare
me. A Waldron never whines, but accepts what comes
of either good or ill, as it is meant and sent.&#8217; I&#8217;m so
glad she doesn&#8217;t whine, nor complain. Granny Briggs
does. Granny isn&#8217;t a bit Waldron-y, though Sophy is&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
more than anybody I know. I think it must be the
highest kind of aristocracy to be willing to give up one&#8217;s
life to save another&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s what Sophy was. Oh!
I love her, I love her!</p>

<p>&#8220;My Cousin Margaret is going to the hospital to visit
Sophy the very first place she does go after her clothes
come. Till then she stays in her rooms, there are several
of them, and denies herself to everybody who comes.
She&#8217;s had lots and lots of calls and offers of a temporary
home but she doesn&#8217;t accept. She doesn&#8217;t need, she says;
yet if she did she <i>would</i> accept very gratefully. Hasn&#8217;t
she the realest, best kind of pride? Oh! I should like to
be just like her, when I am old, only not so fond of putting
on new clothes all the time. I heard one the bell-boys
tell another that she was: &#8216;The great Madam Dalrymple,
the highest-up there was in the world of fashion. That
it was a prestige for this hotel to have her live
here so soon after the accident, and would bring other
patrons.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Margaret is going to take a cottage at Newport.
That is a place by the sea, if you don&#8217;t know. She
says it will be a big house with every &#8216;convenience&#8217; in it,
so I don&#8217;t see why they call it a &#8216;cottage.&#8217; Cottages in
California are so small and haven&#8217;t many rooms in them.
Never mind. I&#8217;m learning things all the time that astonish
me. I guess my education has begun already. I
remember that Mr. Ninian said that &#8216;Education meant
learning how to live, to get the best out of life.&#8217; Seems
if our Cousin Margaret has got a good deal of the best,
since she can stand such an awful sorrow as losing her
home and not &#8216;whine&#8217; once.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>&#8220;She seems more disturbed because her &#8216;man of
business&#8217; hasn&#8217;t called than by anything else. She
hasn&#8217;t any money, course, just getting out of a burning
house that way, not until he comes and brings her some.
She has lots of what she calls &#8216;credit&#8217; and the hotel folks
are terrible polite to her, but she&#8217;d rather have the &#8216;cash
in hand&#8217; to pay in advance. She has never run in debt in
her life. She says that is very &#8216;plebeian&#8217; and she dislikes
plebeian-y things. She sent Tipkins after that &#8216;man
of business&#8217; and he couldn&#8217;t get in. He said the bank-office
was closed and nobody answered. There were a
lot of folks standing around outside the office and he
said maybe they had scared the man of business by a
&#8216;run&#8217; on the bank. He must be a funny kind of a man
that would be scared by a few folks just running!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I must stop for a few minutes. If there&#8217;s anything
more to tell, after we&#8217;ve had the dinner the waiter
is bringing, I&#8217;ll write it then. I&#8217;m so glad Mr. Hale telegraphed
you, so you wouldn&#8217;t worry, after reading about
the fire in the telegraphic column of the paper. Mr.
Hale said that bad news traveled so fast that good news
had to hurry up and catch it. He is such a nice man.
He is going to bring his daughters to see me, soon as they
are out of school for the year.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Good-by, for a little while,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jessica</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The letter was to be resumed and a most important
postscript added. As the girl left the desk, eager for
the tempting dinner being brought into the room and
feeling her blistered fingers sadly painful from her writing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
she was startled by the expression of Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>The lady&#8217;s eyes were closed, she was very pale, the
newspaper she had been reading had fallen from her
nerveless fingers to the floor, and she looked as if, at last,
the full force of the calamity that had befallen had
crushed her beneath its weight. She neither saw nor
heard the entrance of the waiter with his tray nor when
Jessica anxiously demanded: &#8220;Oh! what is the matter?&#8221;
did she answer.</p>

<small>LETTERS AND CHANGES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was some time later when, by Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s
request, Jessica added that postscript:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;Something worse than the house burning has happened.
The &#8216;man of business,&#8217; has run away and taken
all our Cousin Margaret&#8217;s money with him. At least
there&#8217;s nothing left of it, nothing at all. She hasn&#8217;t any
of that needed &#8216;cash in hand&#8217; except the ground the
burned house stood on. That seems funny, but the
ground can be sold and bring money for itself. Till
then Cousin Margaret has had to borrow a little of Mr.
Hale. The worst of it is, she says&mdash;I heard her talking
to Mr. Hale and another lawyer she&#8217;d sent for to come
here right away quick&mdash;the worst is that she is in some
way responsible for some other people losing their money.
She had allowed her &#8216;man of business&#8217; to &#8216;speculate&#8217;
somehow&mdash;Oh! I don&#8217;t understand, nor does even she.
Except that not only has all she thought she had gone,
nobody knows where, but some she didn&#8217;t know she
owed, and that she must pay back if she&#8217;s ever to know
another happy moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;She and the lawyers talked till she got dizzy, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
had been all the time. Then when I heard her dear old
voice go sort of trembly I dared to put my arm around
her and to remind her: &#8216;Don&#8217;t you worry, Cousin Margaret,
my mother and I are Waldrons, too, and we&#8217;ve a
copper mine in California that they say is full of money.
When we get enough dug out we will pay all those folks
and give you back all that &#8220;man&#8221; ran away with. I think
that losing that money isn&#8217;t half as bad as losing that
old home; and don&#8217;t you care a mite!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was right, wasn&#8217;t it? And the two lawyers
looked at one another quick and Cousin Margaret gave
me a little squeeze, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s the Waldron speaking in you, dear. But this
is my affair, not yours nor Gabriella&#8217;s. I shall make
everything good. Nobody can suffer through me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Mr. Hale cried out real sharp, like he used to
when the &#8216;boys&#8217; plagued him and said: &#8216;That dastardly
coward! I hope they&#8217;ll catch him and shut him up for
life!&#8217; But the Madam just looked at him, quiet and
stern, and answered: &#8216;Don&#8217;t say that. It doesn&#8217;t belong
to us to take vengeance. The poor wretch is suffering
more than I am, if he hasn&#8217;t already taken his own
life. Let him go. What is left to me is to get the highest
possible price for the Washington Square land and to
use it as impartially, judiciously, as I can. Will you two
take care of that business for me, reserving for yourselves
a just payment for your services?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they said they would but would take no pay.
But Cousin Margaret smiled and said the future would
arrange all that. So they went away, and she told me to
tell you we could not go to Newport now. She has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
little bit of a place on the Hudson river, somewhere,
that she bought once when she was traveling through the
town just because it was so pretty and would make a nice
home for Tipkins and Barnes, if they should outlive her
and get married. Now, of course, Barnes never will live
there, but Tipkins will. He says he will never leave our
Cousin Margaret while he has strength to serve her, and
that he has money in the bank enough to keep us all a
good long time. He wants his Madam to take it and use
it as if it were her own, which it was once. But she
thanks him just as sweet and says: &#8216;Not till need be,
Tipkins.&#8217; I think that was lovely of him, don&#8217;t you?
Ephy is full of schemes for making money for us all.
But of course, nobody need to worry &#8217;cause of that copper
mine we have; and I&#8217;m rather glad we aren&#8217;t
going to that Newport, though I would have liked to see
the sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Margaret has counter&mdash;counter-demanded, I
guess it is&mdash;all the orders about the new, fine clothes.
She is to have just a few of the very plainest for herself,
and thinks I won&#8217;t need many either. Till the fall when
I go to Madam Mearson&#8217;s school. Even there I shan&#8217;t
want them, and I am so glad. I think it takes so much
trouble to keep changing as I would have had to do if we
had gone to that Newport, where rich people live.
&#8216;Schoolgirls should dress simply&#8217; she says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousin Margaret says there is a tiny garden beside
the little house where we will live, in the country, and
Ephy says he will be able to take care of that. If she
<i>will</i>, that Granny Briggs may go with us, too. Cousin
Margaret says she must befriend her, some way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>&#8220;Now this is the real good-by. Ephraim is going to
put the letter in the mail-box and I do wish it could get
to you right away. It is so long&mdash;a week to go and a
week to come; two whole weeks between us, mother
dear.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Your loving</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jessica.</span>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A week later saw Madam Dalrymple and her household
installed in the small cottage up the river. Tipkins
was still in charge of the house affairs, but old &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
had encased himself in a suit of the overalls
which Granny Briggs &#8220;finished off&#8221; and announced
himself as &#8220;head gardener,&#8221; with &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; first
assistant.</p>

<p>Sophy Nestor was still in hospital. She was rapidly
recovering from her burns and as swiftly learning to
love the refuge she had found. Her heroism had won
her many friends; also her willingness, now, to have the
surgeons &#8220;experiment&#8221; with her deformity. Concerning
this, there was diversity of opinion, with the majority
inclining to the belief that cure was possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Doctors, if both the child and her grandmother
approve, do you go ahead and try. Let no possible expense
be spared. The girl whose life she saved can well
repay for any outlay,&#8221; Madam Dalrymple had assured the
hospital staff on the occasion of that memorable visit
she had made to little Sophy.</p>

<p>To the crippled child, this was almost more wonderful
than the hope of being made straight. To have this
beautiful &#8220;White Hair&#8221; come to that ward and have all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the children in it know that the visit was to her, Sophy!
All just because she had once done&mdash;Why, what any of
them might have done if they had had the chance!</p>

<p>&#8220;Roses? Roses&mdash;for me&mdash;Sophy? Oh! Ma&#8217;am, I ain&#8217;t
worth it! I ain&#8217;t half worth it! Roses&mdash;roses cost a
lot. I know. And &#8217;twas only a laylock that was give to
me, free for nothing, that I was going&mdash;Just laylocks;
but roses! Them kind grows in the hot-houses, I know.
I hope&mdash;I hope nobody didn&#8217;t go without their dinner to
buy &#8217;em!&#8221; protested the flower-girl, half-crying, half-weeping
from sheer delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! no, little maid. Nobody would need do that.
Why do you say so?&#8221; asked the wonderful Madam in her
softest voice, that sounded so like a caress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jessica said you was poor, too, now. Don&#8217;t
seem so. Don&#8217;t &#8217;pear as if it could be,&#8221; returned the
child, critically regarding the plain street costume of her
visitor, and which to the tenant of Avenue A looked as
fine as it was new.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little girl, poverty is comparative. You don&#8217;t
understand that yet, but you will some day. As for you
I trust you will never again be as poor as in those old
days before Buster made you acquainted with my young
cousin. By the way, the broncho is going to be a very
happy horse. He is going to live in the country, away
from all elevated trains and jangling street-cars, though
he&#8217;ll not wholly escape from automobiles. Even the country
isn&#8217;t free from those detestable things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it, ma&#8217;am? What&#8217;s it like, that country?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica listened, amazed to hear Sophy talking so
glibly to her stately Cousin Margaret and to hear that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
lady replying with so much graciousness to this once most
objectionable girl from Avenue A:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the country like? Like Central Park, only
infinitely lovelier. I&#8217;ve a bit of good news for you, too,
my child. That good grandmother of yours is going
with us to our new home. Ephraim Marsh says she
&#8216;hails from Cawnco&#8217;d,&#8217; same as himself and that she is
wearing her heart out here in the great city. He says,
besides, which is more to the point, that she is a fine cook.
So she has promised to go and live with me and do the
family&#8217;s cooking. As soon, then, as you are able to come,
you shall visit us and her. Visit, at first, only; because
if you are to be made just like you&#8217;d wish to be, it will
take many months, maybe even years. You will really
live at the hospital, while Granny lives with us. But it&#8217;s
only an hour or two between; short journeys by rail or
boat, a bit of a ride behind Buster&mdash;and you will be in
the country itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! O-h!&#8221; gasped poor Sophy, too greatly overcome
for further words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Jessica, bid your little friend good-by. You
may write to her and maybe she can write to you&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! ma&#8217;am, I can, I can! Granny made me go to
night school and I can write real plain. If I had any
paper, or money to put on a stamp on the envelope.
You can get them to a drug store and they cost two cents.
The stamps do. Maybe, if you didn&#8217;t mind, some these
hospital folks&#8217;d buy one these roses. Then I could. If
you didn&#8217;t mind so very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you? Well, I fancy a stamp may be procured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
even right here in this hospital and without disposing of
your flowers. I will see that it is provided, with all else
that is necessary. Ah! you poor, beauty-starved child,
to whom roses suggest but sordid money! Well, it will
not be long till you gather roses from bushes out of
doors, and may they there suggest to you only God&#8217;s
goodness and love!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a rare outburst from the reticent Madam;
who was widely known for her liberal, &#8220;organized&#8221;
charities; but who had hitherto contented herself with
such, missing the greater delight of bestowing herself&mdash;her
personal interest and sympathy, which alone make
charity worth anything to its recipient.</p>

<p>Then Cousin Margaret bore Jessica away. Granny
came for a brief, rather unsatisfactory visit, since the
new surroundings in which she found her grandchild
always rather abashed her. Ephraim flew in and out,
like an excited old child, with his arms full of bundles&mdash;of
more or less useless contents, like a toy bear and a pineapple
cheese&mdash;and at last Sophy was alone in that hospital
she had so dreaded.</p>

<p>For a time she felt deserted; but it was only on the
second day that a letter came from Jessica, containing a
stamped, addressed envelope, that made the safe delivery
of Sophy&#8217;s answer a sure thing. Jessie&#8217;s effusion was not
quite so well written as these she had sent home to
California, and this explained itself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dearest Little Heroine</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;We got here all right and Tipkins met us to the
station. He&#8217;d come up ahead of us on the boat with Buster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
and Buster was the trouble. The broncho was all right
on that boat and being led up to the cottage&mdash;it&#8217;s just
lovely! No bigger than lots in California, so I like it
better. Buster had never been harnessed, never in all
his darling life. But I don&#8217;t know how we should get
along without him, &#8217;cause he&#8217;s the only horse we have.
Now. Think of that! Just one little bit of a broncho to
do all the teaming and plowing and everything for a
whole cottage full of folks. Only he won&#8217;t team and he
won&#8217;t plow and he won&#8217;t&mdash;most everything. You know
the span and the carriages and the coachman and footman
were all sold after the fire. I mean the horses were.
They went to pay our board at that big hotel where it
costs a lot of money to stay even a single day. So that
horse&mdash;Buster I mean, this time&mdash;he wouldn&#8217;t draw the
little bit of wagon Tipkins had hired to take your grandmother
and Cousin Margaret up the hill in to the cottage,
and they thought they&#8217;d have to walk. Tipkins was
mad and struck Buster and that made me angry, too.
Ephraim lost his own temper and said he&#8217;d get ahead of
that beast or bust. Fancy! &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; calling my
broncho a &#8216;beast&#8217;!</p>

<p>&#8220;After all it was I that got ahead, not Ephy. I just
got on Buster&#8217;s back and chirruped to him and off he
went, just as if we were starting to race some other
horse across the mesa. Never knew he had that wagon
with folks in it behind him, till I told him to stop; and
then we had got home and it was too late for him to fuss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Ephraim says, I&#8217;ll have to ride him while he
plows that garden, for he&#8217;s going to have the best, old-fashionedest
Yankee kind of a garden that he&#8217;s seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
since he left Concord. He&#8217;s going to raise the same old
marrowfat sort of green pease that Sophia Badger used
to eat when she was a girl, and I do wish you could see
that dear old lady! You&#8217;re going to, soon, anyway. But
she is the happiest! Why, she just picks up handfuls of
green grass, even, and buries her nose in it and says it
&#8216;carries her back to a time when she tramped barefoot
after the cows in the pasture.&#8217; I shouldn&#8217;t think that
would make anybody extra happy, but it seems to, her.
And this morning she came across a little plant of what
she called &#8216;Southernwood,&#8217; or &#8216;Old Man&#8217;&mdash;a queer,
smelly kind of bush that you never sold, I guess, from
your tray&mdash;and she burst right out crying! Said her
own mother used to always carry a sprig of it to meeting
when Granny was a mite of a child. She could see her
mother&#8217;s face, just smelling it, she said. Fancy! Being
the mother of a grandmother! Doesn&#8217;t that seem almost
too old to be believed?</p>

<p>&#8220;My Cousin Margaret is almost as happy as your
Granny. She says life is so simple up here, and it does
her so much good to see anybody so glad as Mrs. Briggs.
I guess we&#8217;re all pretty glad and I am so busy that I
didn&#8217;t write before, because you see Ephy went right at
that garden this very morning and I&#8217;ve been riding
Buster to make him drag that plow without kicking it
out of the furrow every other step.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Sophy Nestor? I&mdash;it seems almost a
wicked thing to say&mdash;but, haven&#8217;t lots of happy things
happened just because that old house burned up? And
my Cousin Margaret is more beautiful than ever. She
doesn&#8217;t worry a bit. Your grandmother and Ephraim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
amuse her all the time and Tipkins is even more devoted
than he used to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be money enough for the little we
need, now we don&#8217;t have to buy so many clothes, and&mdash;Ephraim
is calling me. He wants to go to a seed store
at the Landing and he can&#8217;t make Buster draw the wagon
to fetch him and the tools back again unless I ride on
his back. What a good thing it was all around that Ephy
came to this side the continent and brought Buster with
him! What a good, happy, splendid thing life is, anyway!
Write right away.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Your loving, ever grateful</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The reply to this long letter was brief and to the point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Deer Jessica Trent</span>:</p>

<p>This letter did not reach Jessica, of course, until the
day following the trip to the Landing she had mentioned
in her own. A trip that amused the people whom she
passed along the way because of her novel method of
making the broncho &#8220;go.&#8221; A trip that was to have a
most astonishing ending and one to fill the &#8220;Little Captain&#8217;s&#8221;
soul with unspeakable delight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />


<small>MEETING AND PARTING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> seed-and-tool store was at the Landing, close beside
the wharf where the river boats stopped, on their
way up and down. Across the narrow roadway was, also,
the railway station. Between the whistling of engines,
the rumbling of trains, it proved a most confusing spot
for plain-reared Buster, and while Ephraim entered the
store to make his gardening purchases, the broncho did
his utmost to stand on his head or his hind heels, and in
either direction to cast his rider to the ground.</p>

<p>In vain. The girl had been saddle-bred from her very
infancy and wholly understood the vagaries of this four-footed
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boy, behave yourself. I&#8217;ll neither slip over
your nose nor your tail. Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of
yourself? What&#8217;ll the people around all think of California
horses, if you cut up like this? Whoa! There now,
that&#8217;s better! Silly Buster! To be afraid of a train of
cars that aren&#8217;t coming near you. Look at them. See.
You must get acquainted with them, &#8217;cause you&#8217;ll often,
often see them. Steady, now. Good boy, Buster!&#8221;</p>

<p>A train had whizzed up to the station over the way and
whizzed off again. The track lay behind the station; so
that, at first, alighting passengers were invisible from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
spot where Jessica waited, perched on the pony&#8217;s back,
which wore a harness instead of a saddle. Even to her it
was not a comfortable arrangement and a less experienced
rider would have found it almost impossible.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the broncho&#8217;s eyes wavered from the train
they had watched disappearing northward and came back
to a passenger just coming into sight around the station.
A quiver of some fresh emotion ran through all his sturdy
frame, and with a wild whinny of delight he threw up his
head and bolted across the roadway. Another instant
and Jessica was off his back, in the arms of this passenger,
crying incredulously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! Why, mother! Is it you? Is it my&mdash;<i>Mother</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling, my darling! It is true, then, that you
are quite safe, unharmed?&#8221; returned Mrs. Trent, folding
her daughter close, then holding her off at arm&#8217;s
length, the better to assure herself of the girl&#8217;s safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Buster saw you first! Think of that! The pony
saw and knew you first! But when&mdash;why&mdash;where?
Ned? How happened&mdash;&#8221; demanded the excited &#8220;Little
Captain,&#8221; without pausing for answers to her hurrying
questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Why?</i> because it <i>had</i> to happen. Did you think I
could learn of your peril in that terrible fire and not
come to find you for myself? Indeed, I started within
the hour after Mr. Hale&#8217;s telegram arrived, even though
it was most reassuring and I see now quite true. But,
why are you just here in this place? I stopped at Mr.
Hale&#8217;s office to find the address of Cousin Margaret, but
he was out and only an office boy there. Fortunately he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
found it on the address-book and I took the next train
north. O my darling! My darling little Jess!&#8221;</p>

<p>During this fresh embrace a familiar voice broke upon
that rhapsody of reunion, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a mite more&#8217;n I expected. I&#8217;ve been reckoning
time and I &#8217;lowed to-day was about the limit. How are
you, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent released her daughter to take the outstretched
hands of &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; and to cry, in response:</p>

<p>&#8220;You expected me, Mr. Marsh? But I might have
known. You were always wise and sympathetic. You&#8217;d
have done just the same, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Now, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ve been cipherin&#8217; how&#8217;s best
to get up-hill to that there cottage where we live now. I
reckon the &#8216;easiest way is the purtiest way&#8217; an&#8217; that&#8217;ll be
for me to lead this cantankerous old broncho, that &#8216;hasn&#8217;t
sense enough to go in when it rains,&#8217; and you and &#8216;Little
Captain&#8217; ride up in a &#8216;bus.&#8217; There&#8217;s two or three of
them always standin&#8217; round, waiting for customers. Baggage,
ma&#8217;am? Where&#8217;s that at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is my check. It&#8217;s but a small satchel. I couldn&#8217;t
wait for more&mdash;even if I was going to stay all summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All summer, mother dearest? Oh! how splendid!
Yet&mdash;that won&#8217;t be but a mite of a time, anyway, &#8217;cause
it&#8217;s summer now. June; just think! I&#8217;ve been here
two whole months already.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother might have added: &#8220;They seem like as
many years to me;&#8221; but it wasn&#8217;t her way to dwell upon
unpleasant feelings and she had her arms about her child,
at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>What a ride that was! How the happy tongues flew,
how questions and answers were tossed to and fro, how
plans were laid, events discussed, and the returned
easterner felt that she had come into her own again. California
she loved. In California she would live and die;
but beside this broad old river she had been born and its
rugged, verdure-covered Highlands were most beautiful
in her sight.</p>

<p>And what a welcome followed, when old Margaret and
Gabriella met! How keen the glances with which each
searched the other&#8217;s face and read thereon the lessons
life and the years had taught. Through Mrs. Trent&#8217;s
heart shot a swift pain, beholding in Madam the signs
of a great grief. Despite the valiant front she would
still present to her changed fortunes, the loss of her home
had aged her as the flight of time could not. In repose,
when no necessity for assumed brightness roused her,
she looked to the full what she really was&mdash;an old, old
woman; world-weary, life-weary, though a &#8220;Waldron&#8221;
still!</p>

<p>Also, though she did not acknowledge it, she was
wofully disappointed in Gabriella, whom she remembered
as a gay, bright &#8220;society girl,&#8221; but who was so sadly
changed.</p>

<p>To Granny Briggs, who had begun to usurp the confidences
once enjoyed by Barnes, she regretted:</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousin Gabriella hasn&#8217;t an atom of style. She&#8217;s
become a regular dowd, living out there in that wilderness.
She used to be the most admired girl in our set
and was Madam Mearsom&#8217;s star pupil. She graduated
with highest honors&mdash;My! But she was a beauty, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
day! in her white gown, of the finest, sheerest French
organdie, with billows of filmy lace&mdash;I took good care
that my ward&#8217;s gown should be the handsomest of all
her class&#8217;s. Poor Gabriella! Such a pity, to throw
herself away on a penniless man when she might easily have
married a millionaire and a gentleman of the first family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. But seems if she was real peart and purty
lookin&#8217; yet. I don&#8217;t know much about that &#8216;style,&#8217; I
hear tell of, but she&#8217;s got a kind of voice that makes you
feel warm in your insides when she talks with you; and
that old Ephraim seems to worship the very ground she
treads on. I don&#8217;t know, I ain&#8217;t no judge for the aristocratics,
but seems if bein&#8217; loved that way makes up for not
havin&#8217; that &#8216;style.&#8217; What think she&#8217;d like best for dinner,
to-day? I&#8217;d admire to cook her something as nice as
that old &#8216;Aunt Sally&#8217; of theirs, or that heathen Wun
Lung&#8217;s. Ephraim Marsh, he&#8217;s makin&#8217; great reckonin&#8217; on
that garden of his&#8217;n; but a garden planted in June ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to be no great shakes, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to New Hampshire
notions. What say, we best have? Then I&#8217;ll go buy the
stuff of the nighest huckster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything, anything, dear Mrs. Briggs!&#8221; interrupted
a voice, glad enough to belong to a girl, as Gabriella
peeped in from the little verandah where she had been
writing home to little Ned and where she had overheard
all the above conversation. &#8220;Any sort of eastern
cooking is delicious to me. I haven&#8217;t been so hungry in a
long, long time as since I came &#8216;home.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Not only to little Ned, whose pride at receiving a
letter all his own she could picture, but to that most helpful
lawyer friend, Mr. Hale, had she been writing; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
it was due to his kind offices that soon there joined these
happy cottage folk another who could hardly believe her
good fortune true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! little daughter! That is the best of having this
abundance of money&mdash;though I can scarcely realize yet,
that it is really our own and it&#8217;s right to use it&mdash;that one
may make others happy with it. So Mr. Hale has
arranged with the surgeons in charge to have Sophy Nestor
brought up here to stay as long as we do. I&#8217;ve hired
that other little cottage, across the way&mdash;that empty one&mdash;for
we shall need extra sleeping rooms. She is to be
brought, &#8216;strapped&#8217; as she must be for long to come, and
her attendant nurse with her. The surgeon will run up,
now and then, when it is necessary, and her improvement
will not be hindered because of her coming. Indeed,
the change of air will help her to grow strong. When I
think of what we owe that child&mdash;I am almost overcome
with gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than that, you and I will sail down to the city,
to-morrow morning, and you shall select the very
prettiest little set of furniture you see and it shall be for her
own bedroom. We will give her one happy summer, if
we can, despite that dreadful &#8216;strapping&#8217; and lying still
that is the price of her recovery. Ah! my darling! God
was good to us when He sent old Pedro to show the way
to that copper mine, with its immeasurable results of
benefit to the poor and afflicted!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was always the way Gabriella talked. It was
ever the one thought of her heart that this now rapidly
growing, famous &#8220;Sobrante&#8221; mine was but a trust placed
in her hands and those of her children for the happiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
of other people. It made her very grateful, even more
humble, to have been accounted worthy to hold this
&#8220;trust&#8221;; and, thus listening to the wise mother whom
she adored, little Jessica was in small danger ever of
loving money for money&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>To them sometimes laughingly spoke the more worldly-wise
Madam.</p>

<p>&#8220;But shall you never do anything for the Trents themselves,
my Gabriella? Shall you be always content to
live in a frame house in a wilderness? Is Jessica never
to have the benefit of that &#8216;society&#8217; for which Madam
Mearsom and her own wealth, will fit her? Remember
that a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;is due those poor Trents and
Waldrons!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All in good time, Cousin Margaret. The frame
house has been, is still, the happiest of homes. When
you come out to California to spend next winter in the
sunshine, you&#8217;ll see for yourself how cosy we are.
There is a hospital to be built, first; for so many, many
workmen are coming to our dear Golden Valley, that
there must sometimes be illness or even injury. We
must have a place to care for them. We must have a
fine school. The workmen have wives and children. We
must have homes, dozens of those pretty &#8216;frame cottages,&#8217;
if you please! for them to live in. We must have
a church. Maybe I should have put that first. We must
have stores and libraries&mdash;Oh! there is no end to the
things we must have if&mdash;if that mine holds out to pay
for them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such enthusiasm was contagious. Said the Madam,
with mock dismay:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>&#8220;Hold your tongue, Gabriella Trent! Or the first
thing I know I shall be giving away that parcel of land
in Washington Square for some ridiculous charity. Just
say no more and let me keep my common sense, which
you&#8217;ve almost talked out of my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Cousin Margaret, do give it! Give it, surely. And
let me care for you now as you cared for me when I was
a girl. The only mother I ever knew&mdash;what so fitting
as that you should turn your own proud back on this
&#8216;society&#8217; of fashion and come home with me to
that other, better, more worth-while society of labor,
honesty, and love. You&#8217;ll come, dear? Surely, you will
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And leave our Jessica to the snares of this eastern
&#8216;society,&#8217; which &#8216;toils not, neither does it spin&#8217;? We&#8217;re
a long way from that question of dinner we started with,
and you&#8217;re here for the summer, at least. One request
I have to make. Do me a personal favor. When you go
to town, to-morrow, to buy that Sophy Nestor a set of
furniture, please also buy yourself a decent gown. Even
a ready-made one from a store is preferable to that thing
you have on. The sleeves&mdash;Why, my dear girl, the
sleeves are at least seven years behind the fashion! and
there&#8217;s nothing so betrays the age of one&#8217;s clothes as the
sleeves they wear. Since you came here before you got
Jessica&#8217;s letter&mdash;that&#8217;s the worst of your California, it
takes an age for letters to go to and fro!&mdash;since you came
before then you must know that I have already ordered
a few things for her. They should be finished by this
time and sent up. You can inquire about them. Also,
you can see Melanie and find out about my own things.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Really, Gabriella, you are coming in very handy! I&#8217;ve
been wanting a trustworthy woman to send shopping,
since I&#8217;m to live in the country myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in a merry mood, this proud old dame, happy
through all her love-hungry nature to have her old ward
with her once more. A merry party all; though the
mother sometimes thought longingly of little Ned and
his &#8220;shadow,&#8221; Luis; wondering what sort of mischief
occupied their busy brains at that especial moment. But
mostly she was as gay as her own girl. She had come
away for a holiday and she was wise enough to take it to
the utmost; leaving home cares and fortunes in the capable
hands of Aunt Sally Benton, Mr. Ninian Sharp, and
the faithful &#8220;boys.&#8221; That Sobrante would not seem
really the old Sobrante to them there, with her and
Jessica and &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; absent, she was sure; but
that her welcome, returning, would be all the more delightful
and heartsome she was also sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;All summer together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! How swift are summer days! And that one
came whereon was parting. Another summer would
come and all these with it, it was hoped; but it was a
very sad-faced, if most patient, Sophy Nestor who
looked about her dainty chamber to bid it a winter&#8217;s
farewell. All that pretty furniture, of white, with rosebud
decorations, which had been given to her for her
&#8220;very, very own&#8221;; those soft swaying curtains; that
adorable rosebush outside her window, whereon had been
the roses right at hand to gather freely as she would;
all the love and gayety of that simple cottage life; with
Granny grown a happy-faced old lady, and with her beloved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Jessica attendant on her as on a precious sister&mdash;this
was ended.</p>

<p>The surgeon had come; the nurse had on her street
costume and was waiting; she had herself been capped
and wrapped against some adverse draught; and would
presently be lifted in strong arms and carried on a
comfortable stretcher back to that hospital she now called
home.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;Why, then, so quick one couldn&#8217;t realize it&mdash;everything
was over. Sophy was back on her own little
cot in the children&#8217;s ward, there to become its very life
and comfort, so confident and hopeful and uncomplaining
was she. She had bidden Granny good-by. Granny
who, despising conventions, had been installed in the
dearest little flat that could be found near the hospital,
and was there to keep house just as they did in
&#8220;Cawnco&#8217;d&#8221;&mdash;baked beans and all&mdash;with Ephraim
Marsh as boarder and sole companion. Buster had been
put out to board in the village where he had disgraced
himself by his own odd behavior. Tipkins&mdash;Well, Tipkins,
erect and immaculate as of old, had purchased his
own new livery and was ready to attend his mistress into
those western wilds whither that deluded creature now
was bound. Tipkins had his opinion of anybody, even his
faultless Madam, who would forsake the &#8220;higher civilization&#8221;
of New York, at this time of year, to live in a
frame house on a sort of prairie, with nobody but workmen
and horses, and wild ostriches around. Oh! Tipkins
knew! he hadn&#8217;t listened all these weeks to the talk
that went on among his betters, without understanding
the entire situation, even though he gave no sign.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>&#8220;Madam is getting into her second childhood!&#8221; he
had said in a burst of confidence to Ephraim. &#8220;She&#8217;d
never have done such a thing as this, if she wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! Lots of folks and towerists come to Californy
to spend the winter. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t no fool of a trip,
either. It costs money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, maybe. But they go to the hotels, the big
ones, and pay high and live like the Waldronses had
ought to. But I ain&#8217;t forgetting what she used to be;
and I&#8217;m wearing my livery constant, to remind her that
there&#8217;s others that remember it too. I&#8217;ll show them cowboys
and Chinese laundry-cooks, that I knows what&#8217;s
what, even if they don&#8217;t; and I&#8217;ll teach them what a first-class
English butler is like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; toss back his grizzled head
and laugh. How he did laugh! Almost as if he were at
that moment on the broad plain of Sobrante where none
would be disturbed because of a little noise. And said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Good enough! I like you, Tippy, I plumb do
like you. You&#8217;re straight and white, almost as white as
a Yankee. But I&#8217;d give all my old shoes to see the
&#8216;boys&#8217;&#8217; faces when you arrive in their midst. When you
try to buttle your butlery in their presence&mdash;I tell you,
Tippy, you&#8217;ll strike it rich! If &#8217;twasn&#8217;t for turnin&#8217; my
back on the &#8216;Little Captain,&#8217; now, when she&#8217;s going to
need me the most, I&#8217;d join the homeward-bound myself
just to be on hand when that bottle-green-and-poppy-yeller
livery hits the ranch! Oh! Shucks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again that uncontrollable laughter seized him, fancying
the face of Samson the mighty, when Tipkins the
haughty should appear before him; and bending himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
double he retreated lest this untimely mirth should jar
upon the feelings of others, to whom this day brought
grief.</p>

<p>In the handsome drawing-room of Madame Mearsom,
Mrs. Dalrymple, Gabriella, and poor Jessica gathered for
a last embrace. Madam herself supported them by the
kindly dignity of her deportment&mdash;exactly what that
deportment should have been at such a time and such a
moment. One glance at her countenance showed her
eminently fitted to assume the charge and education of a
&#8220;young lady of the higher class,&#8221; it was so benign, so
composed, and so intelligent.</p>

<p>But Jessica had scarcely looked at her. She had eyes,
at that moment only for that beloved face of her mother
which would vanish in a moment and leave her alone.</p>

<p>Hark! The door has already closed! the dear face has
vanished! &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; <i>is</i> alone! On the threshold
of a new, unknown life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />


<small>JESSICA ENTERS SCHOOL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Now</span>, my dear, I will introduce you to your mates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica caught her breath with a sob, but her blue eyes
were dry and her face piteously white and grief-stricken.
This second parting from her beloved mother had been
harder than the first. It was with a feeling of utter desolation
that she followed Madam Mearsom into the pleasant
recreation-room where most of the pupils of the
school were gathered.</p>

<p>These were not many in number; that number &#8220;strictly
limited&#8221; to those whose guardians were willing to pay
an extremely high tuition price. But it is just to add that
the price was well deserved. While known as a &#8220;fashionable&#8221;
establishment it was yet a most thorough one,
affording its graduates as complete an education as they
could have obtained at a woman&#8217;s college. In that respect,
Jessica&#8217;s new home had been well chosen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young ladies, I have the pleasure to present to you,
Miss Jessica Trent, of Sobrante, California. I trust that
you will make her very happy among you. Miss Rhinelander,
Miss Trent&#8217;s desk will be next your own in the
study-room. Kindly do the honors of our house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam, with great pleasure,&#8221; answered a tall,
dark-eyed girl, moving forward with an air as composed
and self-possessed as that of the schoolmistress herself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
With a graceful, sweeping courtesy, she offered her hand
to the newcomer, who accepted it gratefully enough, yet
with the feeling that nothing mattered now.</p>

<p>Helen Rhinelander was instantly offended. She was
the leader in the school, by reason of her ability and social
position. Also, by a certain sort of arrogance which impressed
her followers as something extremely fine and
full of &#8220;distinction.&#8221; To be &#8220;<i>distingu&eacute;</i>&#8221; was, at
Madame Mearsom&#8217;s, the height of elegance.</p>

<p>Now, Miss Rhinelander&#8217;s glance swept Jessica&#8217;s simple
costume, of that unadorned blue flannel her mother
so greatly liked, and there was disdain in the glance.
This disdain was observed and copied by a few.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen&#8217;s own clothes are very simple&mdash;but then!
They are of the finest, and cut with such a grace. She
is style itself. Why, she&#8217;s stylish even in her nightgown!&#8221;
had remarked one young miss to another, and
had tried to make her own dressmaker copy this &#8220;style&#8221;&mdash;with
poor result.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dowd!&#8221; &#8220;Common!&#8221; &#8220;pretty enough, but&mdash;Oh!
my!&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s simply impossible! I doubt if even
Madam can make that new girl over into anybody presentable.&#8221;
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a shame to admit such people to
our school. My father sends me here because he believed
it to be so very exclusive. She isn&#8217;t exclusive.
She might be anybody. She might even live&mdash;anywhere.&#8221;
&#8220;Looks as if she came from California, or some
other outlandish place.&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s a dear. How sad she
looks and how brave, not to cry when she&#8217;s so longing
to.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about her. She was the girl that was
found in the garden of Madam Dalrymple&#8217;s mansion in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Washington Square; when it was burned another girl, a
flower-girl, saved her life.&#8221; These were the unspoken
opinions that greeted Jessica.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen&mdash;Helen isn&#8217;t&mdash;nice!&#8221; whispered Aubrey Huntington
to her chum and satellite. Now when a schoolgirl
is dubbed &#8220;not nice&#8221; by her mates, the chances are
that she is extremely disagreeable. Also, a person may
be that, yet remain perfectly well bred.</p>

<p>Helen prided herself on her breeding, yet she did not
hesitate to elevate her eyebrows slightly, as she conducted
Jessica to a low chair in the pleasantest corner of
the room, where one could look out on the broad Avenue,
with its passing throngs and vehicles, and through which
a soft September breeze was blowing.</p>

<p>Jessica accepted the chair with a low &#8220;Thank you,&#8221;
and turned her face toward the window. The breeze
cooled her cheek, that burned beneath the glances of all
these strangers, yet the throngs outside but served to increase
her own loneliness. In fancy she could hear the
&#8220;chug-chug&#8221; of the train bearing her dear ones far
away; and before she knew it the tears were streaming
down her face and she could see nothing even of the
throngs. She did not attempt to stay them, she could not.
Neither did she lift her handkerchief to wipe them off.
She was ashamed of her own weakness, it was so un-Waldron-y,
and she hoped none of those bright creatures
yonder had seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she had only let me go to my room alone! Just
for a little time till I got used to it!&#8221; she thought. Then
felt something soft and dainty touch her cheek, got a
whiff of delicate perfume, and heard a voice whispering:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look &#8217;round. Stare right out the window, hard
as ever. In a minute Helen and her clique&#8217;ll be going
out&mdash;It&#8217;s exercise hour; and, lucky for us, I&#8217;ve a cold in
my head and am excused. I always <i>do</i> get a cold in my
head, whenever I have a chance. It lets you off so many
things. There! They&#8217;re going. Madam won&#8217;t insist
upon you, not this first day. You&#8217;re a &#8216;new-er.&#8217; &#8216;New-ers&#8217;
get scot of heaps of things. Now, they&#8217;ve gone;
every one except Natalie, and she doesn&#8217;t count. She
generally is in disgrace, Nat is. Come here, Natalie
Graham. This is Jessica Trent. She&#8217;s cried my hanky
full, give me yours. Hold on. You better keep it and
sop her cheeks yourself while I go bring that box of
choccies I hid in my bed. I had to take them out the box
&#8217;cause that would have showed, but I left &#8217;em in the paper.
Whew! Jessica Trent! I never saw a girl cry so much
nor such awful great tears in all my life. Nattie&#8217;s
hanky&#8217;ll be soaked, too, in a minute, if you don&#8217;t let up.
See if you can&#8217;t stop before I get back. I cried, too, the
day I was a &#8216;new-er&#8217; but not that way. Stick to her, Nat,
and make her know it&#8217;s not so bad when you get used to
it. You can get used to anything, you know, even the
&#8216;corrective medicine&#8217; Madame has given to us, now
and then, for our complexions.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the &#8220;sopping&#8221; process had been thoroughly
accomplished, Jessica had ceased to weep from
sheer astonishment, and the lively, whispering comforter
had betaken herself in search of prohibited &#8220;Choccies,&#8221;
otherwise a rich chocolate dainty. The proprietor of
these had never known a grief that a pound of &#8220;Huyler&#8217;s&#8221;
could not cure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>Jessica looked after the plump, retreating figure, with
its starched and sadly berumpled white frock, its extravagantly
large bows that stood out from a brilliant
red head at absurd angles, and its odd air of being made
up of bits, rudely flung together in great haste. The
effect was amusing enough to bring a smile even to her
lips, sad though she was, and she demanded of the
&#8220;sopper&#8221; who remained:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that? Is she a pupil here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Aubrey Huntington. Yes, she&#8217;s a pupil,
that is, she&#8217;s here; but she doesn&#8217;t pupil very much.
She&#8217;s in so many scrapes she doesn&#8217;t have time. Anyway,
she doesn&#8217;t need. She&#8217;s so awful rich. Her father
is, I mean, and he gives Aubrey heaps and heaps of
spending-money, even though Madame doesn&#8217;t approve.
Why, he&#8217;s richer even than Helen Rhinelander&#8217;s mother,
and that family think they own the earth. Helen&#8217;s father
is dead, and she&#8217;s an heiress. She&#8217;s awful smart. Stands
head in all her classes and plays the piano to beat the band.
Oh! I ought not to have said that. It&#8217;s slang, and
Madame is very particular about our using slang. There
isn&#8217;t much of anything that Madame isn&#8217;t particular
about. But I love her. I certainly do. She&#8217;s just like a
mother to us if we&#8217;re in trouble, or ill, or anything; except,
well, except when we get into scrapes and then she&#8217;s
more like a&mdash;a father. My name is Natalie Graham.
Oh! I forgot, Aubrey told you. She and I are sort of
cousins and Madame used to let us room together. This
year she won&#8217;t. She says Aubrey does me a great deal
of harm and I&#8217;m not the restriction on Aubrey that I
should be, being six months older, so. Some of the girls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
room alone. I guess you will, &#8217;cause all the double
rooms are full. I guess you&#8217;ll be in our form, too.
Aubrey can draw lovely. I mean she can draw funny;
but her folks have forbidden her drawing any more because
they want her to study the piano. Her father says
he must have somebody in the family that can make a
little music and soothe an idle hour and Aubrey&#8217;s the
only child there is, so she&#8217;s shut off on drawing and
pinned down to practising. She won&#8217;t be long, though.
She can coax her father to let her do &#8217;most anything.
She says it&#8217;s a great deal easier to buy a pianola and let
the music play itself on that, and she&#8217;s in for a pianola.
She says she&#8217;s going to be a comic illustrator and make
pictures for the funny papers. She could do it, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems as if she were gone a long time. I&mdash;I bet
something&#8217;s happened! Ah! Here she comes now.
Have you got done crying? Choccies won&#8217;t taste half as
nice, if you haven&#8217;t, with tears on them. Heigho! Aub!
What kept you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Snooper.&#8217; She&#8217;s in with a headache, or a fit
of the &#8216;snoops&#8217; more like. She&#8217;s got it into her long
head that I&#8217;ve been doing something forbidden again,
and just casually strayed into my room to find out. First
thing she did she sat right down on my bed, kerflump!
And there, in that very spot, between the sheets were
these precious sweeties. Look at them, will you? Isn&#8217;t
that enough to try the soul of a saint? Which I&#8217;m not.
Poor choccies! To be smashed by the &#8216;Snooper.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I sat down in the chair and she sat on the bed;
and I said just as politely deportment-y as I could:
&#8216;Beg pardon, Miss Stewart, but I&#8217;m excused from exercise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
to-day, on account of my bad cold, and I&#8217;ve retired
to my room for a little privacy and&mdash;and meditation.&#8217;
That&#8217;s where I made a mistake. Saying &#8216;meditation.&#8217;
&#8216;Snooper&#8217;s&#8217; a faddist on meditation. Says it so improves
our souls and a lot more bosh. So she decided
she&#8217;d stay and meditate with me. And she did. But
I ousted her at last. <i>I sang!</i> As soon as I began she
put up her hand to make me stop, but the higher she
held it the more I warbled, and in time she fled. But
not till after she&#8217;d squashed these dear choccies all flat.
Never mind. They were in the waxed paper and we can
lick &#8217;em off. Try some, Jessica. There&#8217;s nothing so
good for a broken heart as a fresh cream drop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody could withstand this nonsensical, merry girl.
Certainly not Jessica Trent, even though she did wince at
that reference to &#8220;broken hearts;&#8221; and in another moment
the trio were deep in the enjoyment of the sweets
which two of them knew were prohibited &#8220;between
meals&#8221; though the &#8220;new-er&#8221; did not. Also, each was
frankly imparting all the facts of her personal history,
and the stranger was swiftly learning that there was still
a good deal of happiness left in life. Here were &#8220;girls,&#8221;
that race of which she knew so little; here was no grave
talk of &#8220;duty&#8221; and &#8220;trusts&#8221; and the serious matters
which interested grown folks; and here, once more, Jessica
began to feel as she had used in the old home at
Sobrante before any troubles came to it, to make her
thoughtful beyond her years.</p>

<p>Suddenly said Aubrey:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! My cold in the head isn&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s stuffy
in here. It&#8217;s recreation afternoon, anyway, and no lessons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
till study hour at night. Let&#8217;s get our things and
take a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Aubrey! How can we without a teacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal better than with one. It&#8217;s teacher&#8217;s
day off, too, our class walking one. Oh! come on, Natalie.
Don&#8217;t be tiresome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be tiresome. I want to go. I&#8217;ll
run ask Madame. Probably she&#8217;ll tell Miss Leonard to
look after us, or she might even send the groom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the kind, Natalie Graham.
Madame has a managers&#8217; meeting in the big drawing-room.
I heard them managing as I went through the
upper hall. Miss Leonard is too strict. I&#8217;d rather stay
at home than go out with that linen-room woman. Come
on. I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! Where Aubrey led the way, the weaker Natalie
was apt to follow. Therefore, the first act of Jessica&#8217;s
life at school was one of disobedience. The strictest
rule of Madame Mearsom&#8217;s establishment was against
her pupils&#8217; going upon the streets alone, without the protection
of someone in authority.</p>

<p>But Aubrey was a born New Yorker. She knew, or
fancied that she knew, all its streets and avenues, having
seen many of them from the safety of her father&#8217;s
carriage&mdash;rarely from the point of a pedestrian&mdash;save
on those prim walks of the scholars, such as most of
them were now taking.</p>

<p>Once upon the street, she advised:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s go the regular route. There&#8217;s no fun
meeting the others. If we do we&#8217;ll have to fall into line
and go, &#8216;miminy-piminy&#8217; just as usual. New York is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
all in squares. Let&#8217;s go by this east square and then
around the block home again. We can do that as many
times as we like and stay out till we&#8217;re tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s,&#8221; agreed Natalie, seeing nothing
dangerous in such a plan. Nor did Jessica object. She
followed in all innocence and ignorance whatever the
affectionate Aubrey suggested. But after one round of
the block, that lively girl tired of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! There&#8217;s nothing to see here. I want to
see something. Something except brown-stone houses
and a few carriages before them. Hark! I hear music!
Guess it is a hand-organ! Oh! I love hand-organs!
Especially if they have monkeys to them. Hurry up!
Come on! Isn&#8217;t this a lark?&#8221;</p>

<p>Natalie made a vain clutch at the starched and fleeing
skirt, which eluded her grasp as its wearer dashed onward
around the next corner and eastward along a cross
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a hand-organ! And there <i>is</i> a monkey&mdash;The
dearest, delightfullest one ever! Hurry up, girls, do
hurry up. See? There are children dancing on the
pavement. Oh! how pretty and how jolly!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was both pretty and extremely &#8220;jolly.&#8221; Older eyes
than these have watched the unconscious, small street-dancers,
lured from their poor homes by the melody
of &#8220;Money Musk&#8221; or its like, though wheezed from a
weather-beaten hurdy-gurdy; and none of these three
now remembered aught they should.</p>

<p>For them there was also lure in the music and in
the antics of the red-clad monkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how perfectly, delightfully &#8216;plebeian!&#8217;&#8221; cried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Aubrey, her own nimble feet keeping time to those entrancing
strains and catching Jessica about the waist to
make her join in that mad whirl. &#8220;I can just fancy
Helen Rhinelander&#8217;s face when I tell her, to-night, where
we have been and what we&#8217;ve done. Ever been to dancing
school, Jessica?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. Never mind, you&#8217;ll learn soon. We
have the finest teacher in the city. Come on, Nat!
Let&#8217;s take a turn!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not one but many; and soon the surroundings changed
and even reckless Aubrey paused and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho! I guess we&#8217;d better be going back. The
man is putting up his monkey, he isn&#8217;t going to play any
more, it must be nearly supper time. We <i>must</i> go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes we must,&#8221; agreed Natalie, earnestly. &#8220;You
walk between us, Jessie Trent. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve
come to our school. We&#8217;ll have the very nicest times
together, we three. Won&#8217;t we, Aubrey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, we will,&#8221; answered she.</p>

<p>But her companions noticed that her voice had lost
its usual enthusiasm, and that she now paused to look
about her with a puzzled air. As a leader she suddenly
felt responsible for her comrades in mischief and remarked,
rather soberly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the way. We&#8217;re going wrong. The numbers
on the houses&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know there were such
poor houses anywhere, so dingy and so small; but the
numbers run up high, as you go north. I know that.
In time we&#8217;ll get to Madame Mearsom&#8217;s if we watch the
numbers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>Unfortunately to have watched the numbers of the
streets would have been the safer way, than those upon
the houses. These continually grew larger and larger
and as constantly more uninviting. Finally, poor Aubrey
stopped short. Her ruddy face had grown quite pale,
and her breath came fast, as she announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, we are&mdash;lost! But we mustn&#8217;t get scared nor
say a word to anybody, nor ask a single question. We
must just find our own way home. Else we&#8217;ll be taken
to a station-house, or worse&mdash;be kidnapped! That&#8217;s
what my father is always afraid of, that somebody will
kidnap me, big as I am, so as to make him pay a lot of
money to get me back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s &#8216;kidnapped?&#8217;&#8221; asked Jessica in awed and
wondering ignorance. Nor did her heart grow lighter
when these two, long ago enlightened on that dread subject
by the words of maids and nurses, explained to her
its awful meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we mustn&#8217;t ask, as you say. Else I would have
called that policeman yonder, just as Mr. Hale and my
Cousin Margaret always bade me do if I was in trouble.
We&#8217;ll just walk right straight along, with our heads high
up as if we weren&#8217;t afraid and didn&#8217;t care at all, and
after a while we&#8217;ll get somewhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Jessica, you darling! You&#8217;re just the nicest ever.
You give me lots of courage. Yes, we&#8217;ll do that. Stop
crying, Natalie. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they set valiantly forth, though the early nightfall
was now swiftly coming; but the &#8220;somewhere&#8221; they
sought was far and hard to find.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />


<small>HOW THE FIRST DAY ENDED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three girls walked on till, as Natalie said, their
legs &#8220;felt like sticks, hopping up and down&#8221; and Aubrey
was in a frenzy of fear. This was so unlike her that it
had a most terrifying effect on Natalie and even Jessica
was dismayed. Then, too, she suddenly remembered
that she had once before been &#8220;lost&#8221; on a Los Angeles&#8217;
street and that a &#8220;station-house,&#8221; such as these girls
dreaded, had been her refuge. They had come to an open
lot, whereon a row of buildings was to be erected, the
cellars already dug; and upon some of the stones heaped
there they sat down to consult.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be afraid to go back now. I&mdash;I&#8217;m awful afraid,
anyway. I guess, I guess our &#8216;lark&#8217; wasn&#8217;t so nice
as it seemed. I was never out in the dark like this, without
grown-ups with me. Madame&mdash;I daren&#8217;t think of
Madame! Nor of my father. The last time I got
into disgrace he said that the next time he would punish
me by making me stay at school during all the Christmas
holidays. And now&mdash;the &#8216;next time&#8217; has come.
Madame will never overlook this runaway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubrey, hush! Don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried frightened Natalie,
more disturbed by these words of her leader than even
by her present condition. Till then, though anxious, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
had not had the least doubt but that they were still on that
road to &#8220;somewhere&#8221; which Jessica had suggested, or
that &#8220;somewhere&#8221; would not be in the immediate
vicinity of their school.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that we&#8217;ve done wrong, real wrong,
coming away without being told we might?&#8221; demanded
Jessica, with sudden anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. You didn&#8217;t think we were doing the other
thing&mdash;&#8216;right&#8217;&mdash;did you? Madame will punish us awfully
if&mdash;if we ever get back. She&#8217;ll stop our pocket
money and give us extra lessons and&mdash;Oh! dear! I wish
I&#8217;d never&mdash;never come!&#8221; answered Aubrey, collapsing
to that degree she sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>Natalie also began to wail, in an audible and most distressing
manner. She was a girl greatly afraid of &#8220;the
dark&#8221; and the dark was swiftly coming. October days
are short, even when brightest, and the sky was now
overclouded with signs of an approaching storm. An
icy breeze swept round the open place and set them
shivering, and the keen hunger of healthy schoolgirls
added to their discomfort.</p>

<p>A policeman came along and Jessica made prompt decision;
calling eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;O sir! Will you tell us how to get home? We&#8217;re
lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and came toward them, even though Aubrey
and Natalie clutched at her frock, whispering:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t! That station-house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where <i>is</i> your home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without thinking Jessica replied: &#8220;Sobrante, California.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>&#8220;Whew! Quite a distance, that! However, where
are you staying here, in New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aubrey had regained her courage and drawn near and
promptly gave Madame Mearsom&#8217;s address.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. That&#8217;s a long way, too, though not so bad as
California. There&#8217;s no street car-line will take you,
convenient, but&mdash;have you any money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was odd. Girls wealthy enough to belong at a
fashionable boarding-school, on the street alone at this
time of night without any money&mdash;things began to look
dubious. Besides, and here the astute officer scanned
their attire, they were none of them richly dressed. They
were very likely runaways from some reformatory, or
public institution, and the best place for them, anyway,
till their story could be sifted, was the nearest station-house.
This was not far distant, and thither they were
now escorted, despite their voluble protests.</p>

<p>At least Aubrey and Natalie were voluble, and Jessica
listened, growing wise. To be shut up in a station-house
meant the worst possible disgrace. It meant, probably,
a prison, and though they had sometimes felt that the
Adelphi, as the Mearsom establishment was called, was
&#8220;as bad as a prison&#8221; they changed their minds when
confronted with the real thing.</p>

<p>At last &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; got her own chance to speak
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a way out. If this kind policeman&mdash;&#8221;
the other girls shuddered&mdash;&#8220;if this kind policeman will
either get a carriage, to take us to &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217;s,&#8217; or
will send for him to come to this station-house, it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
be all right. My Ephraim will pay for us if there is anything
to pay and will take us either to his flat or to
Madame&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer was not only willing to do this but it was
his duty; but it was a very grave little group which
waited in that big, bare room of the building while
Ephraim was being summoned. Fortunately, the apartment
he occupied was supplied with telephone fixtures,
and he had been as charmed as a boy with the idea of
talking over a wire with his &#8220;Little Captain,&#8221; whenever
he felt inclined. So he promptly had the proper &#8220;connections&#8221;
made and was now reached without difficulty
or delay. Indeed, that &#8220;Hello!&#8221; was never more
promptly answered than when it brought the information:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a girl in this station says you know her,
Jessica Trent. She wants you to come and take her&mdash;wherever
she belongs. There&#8217;s three of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim sprang away from the instrument with a
shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear that, Sophia Badger&mdash;Briggs? My little
lass, she&#8217;s made herself into three Jessica Trents&mdash;and
gone and got herself into the lock-up! Wasn&#8217;t it well
I stayed behind with you? Didn&#8217;t travel back to Sobrante
with the crowd? I knew it. I felt it in my
bones my girl&#8217;d want me. She can&#8217;t do without her
old Ephy, yet! Thank the Lord I&#8217;m here! Where&#8217;s
my hat? I say, Sophia Badger, where&#8217;s my hat?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a state of wild excitement, the sharpshooter tore
round and round the tiny rooms, into one and out of
another, searching everywhere for an article he felt was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
necessary if he would make a respectable appearance at
that dreadful police-station; but which he wouldn&#8217;t have
delayed for, had not so much been at stake.</p>

<p>Poor Granny was equally flustered. She had learned
to love Jessica almost as much as she did Sophy, and the
very name of &#8220;station&#8221; held terror for her. So many,
so very many of her old neighbors in Avenue A
had journeyed to such a place and had not returned,
having been forwarded to &#8220;the Island&#8221; for a longer
stay.</p>

<p>It was impossible to connect innocent Jessie with any
crime, yet what but crime could send a girl old enough
to tell where she lived to such a place? So perturbed
was she that she unconsciously thrust her spectacles up
over her cap, the better to see, and thus discovered the
missing object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ephraim Marsh! If we ain&#8217;t two old fools
together! Your hat&#8217;s on your head and has been all the
time. More shame to you, wearing it indoors so much,
as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not tarry to hear her reproof. With a
disgusted &#8220;Shucks&#8221; he was off and away; hailing the
first cab he saw and with a recklessness new to one of
his thrift, offering the driver double pay if he would
make double-quick time. Therefore, it was sooner than
they had hoped when he joined the waiting girls;
two of whom were rather surprised to see the third
throw herself into the veteran&#8217;s arms with a cry of
delight;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Ephy! you darling! I knew you&#8217;d come. I knew
you wouldn&#8217;t fail! But, Ephraim, what shall I do?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
This very day, this very first day without her, I&#8217;ve done
that will almost break my mother&#8217;s heart. I have&mdash;Oh!
I am so unhappy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now did the sharpshooter&#8217;s face take on a sternness all
unknown to &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; as, putting her away from
he demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it! Tell the whole story from A to Izzard.
What you done? It can&#8217;t be&mdash;the sky hasn&#8217;t fell yet!&mdash;it
can&#8217;t be that you&#8217;ve <i>took what didn&#8217;t</i>&mdash;What you
done, quick?&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood the horrible suspicion that his scant
knowledge of station-houses had aroused and was indignant
in her turn, but promptly related the not very
&#8220;criminal&#8221; events of the past few hours; ending with
the request:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take us back to Madame Mearsom&#8217;s in that
carriage you came in? She has money of mine and&mdash;Oh!
do, quick, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>A gentleman approached, with notebook and pencil
in hand. He was courteous and interested, and eager
to serve the paper which employed him, but Jessica had
been instructed by Ninian Sharp concerning reporters
and their ways and her heart took instant fright. With
an appealing gesture she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;O sir! Please don&#8217;t write this down. Don&#8217;t let it
get printed. If it did and my mother saw it, as she
would, &#8217;cause now she reads all the New York news
quick, it would break her heart. If it didn&#8217;t that it would
make her dreadfully ashamed because&mdash;because we are
the Waldrons and mustn&#8217;t do disgraceful things. Please,
don&#8217;t write about it, please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>The man was young and anxious for &#8220;copy&#8221; and its
wage, but he couldn&#8217;t withstand that petition.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then, Miss. I won&#8217;t. But it seems a pity&mdash;might
make a good story&mdash;However, let it go.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was due to the lessons of far-away Ninian that this
escapade was kept out of the city papers and Madame
Mearsom spared the chagrin of seeing it in print. How
it affected her when, a half-hour later the runaways
were once more safely in her presence, they were yet
to learn. At present, all she did was to thank Ephraim
for his escort of the girls and to offer repayment of the
carriage hire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I thank you. There&#8217;s nobody beholden.
I&#8217;ve got a good job now, a-teachin&#8217; customers to shoot
in a shooting-gallery up town. My hours are from seven
till &#8217;leven and I must be goin&#8217;. About what time of day
is it most convenient for you to have me visit &#8216;Little
Captain.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame&#8217;s countenance underwent a curious change.
One could not say just what this was, yet old &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
felt that he had not pleased. Her answer was disappointing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our pupils are at liberty to receive their friends
once a week, on Thursday afternoons, from four
till six. Good evening. Young ladies, attend me,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Marsh went away a perplexed man. He had remained
behind in New York simply to be near his beloved
girl. If he was to be allowed to visit her but once
a week and then in presence of other people, including
that stately Madame&mdash;as her words seemed to imply&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
wasn&#8217;t going to be much comfort for either him
or Jessica.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll stay, all the same. The idee! Only part of
a day under that woman&#8217;s care an&#8217; the care so slack &#8217;t
my little miss landed in a station-house! More&#8217;n that,
though she seemed dreadful relieved to get her scholars
safe back again, I &#8217;low that schoolma&#8217;am isn&#8217;t apt to
give &#8217;em no great shakes of a supper. Wish Jessie was
going home with me now to Sophia Badger&#8217;s fried oysters.
Early in the season for &#8217;em, the market man said,
but I&#8217;ll relish &#8217;em. That&#8217;s one good thing about the
east and as poor in Californy&mdash;oysters is plenty here
and scurce there. Heigho! What next&#8217;ll happen, I
wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left at the Adelphi Jessica felt once more forsaken.
As soon as they had reached her own private sitting-room,
Madame Mearsom made each pupil tell her story,
that by this triple repetition she might arrive at the exact
truth. When they had finished, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubrey, you are the one most at fault. You will
retire to your room where supper will be sent you. You
will be put in &#8216;solitude&#8217; for a week and you will not go
out of doors, except to take your exercise in the garden,
during the same length of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Natalie, you may go below and ask a maid to serve
you, though it is long past the regular supper hour. You
will then retire to your room, study the lessons for to-morrow,
and remain there for the rest of the evening.
During the week of Aubrey&#8217;s confinement you are to have
as little to do with her as is consistent with good breeding
and the duties of your form.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>&#8220;Jessica, you will remain with me. I have not yet
had my own supper and you may share it. I will also
improve the opportunity for examining you as to your
scholarship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubrey and Natalie, I wish you good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each culprit turned and made a reverent obeisance,
then slowly retired; but not before Aubrey had had
time to make a grimace in Jessica&#8217;s direction and, by a
vivid pantomime, to declare:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d a deal rather be in my own shoes than yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that moment the Californian was pitying the
other because of the &#8220;solitude&#8221; imposed; which, however,
later experience proved was nothing more serious
than being debarred from the general amusements and
occupations of her mates. &#8220;In the school but not of the
school&#8221; was their own definition of this punishment, and
to lively Aubrey the most severe.</p>

<p>It was a very dainty supper served to Madame and her
pupil; and so gentle, sympathetic, and full of understanding
did that lady now seem, that Jessica was
speedily talking with a freedom she had not dreamed possible.</p>

<p>Gradually, by skillful questions and frank answers, the
schoolmistress learned all of the &#8220;Little Captain&#8217;s&#8221; life;
and realized how difficult the girl would find the necessary
discipline of her future. Not until the dessert was
finished and the white-capped maid had carried away the
trays, did the subject of the afternoon&#8217;s &#8220;runaway&#8221;
come up. Even then it was lightly dismissed with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, now that you know better and understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
that nothing must be done without the approval of
some authorized person, you will not transgress again.
Aubrey is a dear child; as warm-hearted and lovable as
one could desire; and in time&mdash;in good time&mdash;she will
develop into a charming woman. Only be on the watch
while with her lest her &#8216;fun&#8217; should lead you into mistakes.
For Natalie, I may say the same, except that
Natalie is a follower as naturally as Aubrey is a leader.
One afternoon has made you close friends with two of
your mates&mdash;a mutual &#8216;scrape&#8217; seems to be a certain
bond between girls&mdash;and before long you will know them
all. The same sorts of persons you will meet, by and by,
in the world at large. As you influence them now, or
are influenced by them, will you do then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that is a good deal of a sermon for me. I don&#8217;t
often lecture my girls; for I want them, and I especially
want you&mdash;Gabriella&#8217;s daughter&mdash;to look upon me as
their best friend, their second mother, and to confide in
me as they would in her. Now, kiss me, Jessica, and let
us call the slate washed clean of this unfortunate happening.
I thank you for preventing that reporter recording
the episode in the public press, as I judge you
did. It was very wise in you. I hope you&#8217;ll prove as
wise in other matters.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, here is a real slate. I&#8217;ll write on it
a real example and let me see what you know of practical
arithmetic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s heart sank. Already she had fallen in love,
after impulsive schoolgirl fashion, with this stately
woman who could yet be so gentle and so kind, and
she foresaw defeat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>&#8220;Yes, Madame Mearsom, I&#8217;ll try. But&mdash;I know you&#8217;ll
be dreadfully disappointed. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know anything,
seems if, after hearing those other girls talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that. There may be a difference in the
amount of knowledge and in the kinds. You have brains
enough. Don&#8217;t disparage them. Remember what Goethe
said: &#8216;What you can do, or think you can, begin it.
Boldness hath genius, power, and magic in it.&#8217; That&#8217;s
only a simple example in arithmetic. Be bold and say
to yourself &#8216;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame leaned back a little in her high-backed chair
and took up the evening paper, while Jessica fixed her
eyes upon the written problem. Alas! the figures danced
before her as if they were bewitched. Do her utmost
she could not possibly tell what would be the difference
in the amount of labor performed by two men, one working
eight hours per day for eight days, and the other ten
hours on six days.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes of hopeless computation on her
part and patient waiting on her examiner&#8217;s the student
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It seems as simple as A, B, C; but
I haven&#8217;t the least idea of that &#8216;difference,&#8217; I don&#8217;t see an
atom of sense in the whole question. I&mdash;I hate arithmetic,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no you don&#8217;t. Hate is too strong a word for a
young gentlewoman to use, except on the extremest provocation.
You simply do not know. That&#8217;s nothing.
You <i>will</i> know some day, soon. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here.
Let us try geography. Where is Prince Edward&#8217;s
Island?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea!&#8221; cried poor Jessie, with
scarlet face.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many kings of England have been named
Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that any had been.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame smiled. Here surely was &#8220;virgin soil&#8221;
wherein to plant the seeds of learning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about the government of our
country? In what it consists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course. There&#8217;s a President and&mdash;and&mdash;and other
folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly correct. We will pass over the &#8216;other
folks&#8217; till a future day. Please spell &#8216;separate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ninian had drilled Jessica during the winter past
on the fine art of orthography and here, at last, she
felt herself secure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I can, easily: &#8216;Sepperate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Madame Mearsom folded her paper and touched a
bell. A maid appeared, and received the order:</p>

<p>&#8220;Assemble the young ladies for evening prayers.
Then return and show Miss Trent to her room and see
that she has everything comfortable. She is excused
from further exercises on this first day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to this abashed &#8220;new-er&#8221; she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;form&#8217; at present existing in the school
which you are fitted to enter. I will arrange a special
course for you and special instructors. Good night. I
hope you will sleep well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep well!&#8221; thought poor Jessica, tossing on her
white bed in the charming room assigned to her. &#8220;Why&mdash;I
was never so ashamed in all my life! I&mdash;I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
she knows I don&#8217;t know anything! and the &#8216;boys&#8217; said
I was so terr&#8217;ble smart! Sleep? I&#8217;m too mortified to
sleep; &#8217;cause though she didn&#8217;t tell me I know she
knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But promptly, amid this maze of &#8220;knows&#8221; and
&#8220;don&#8217;t knows&#8221; and with the hot flush of mortification
on her cheek, our heroine had passed into the land of
dreams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />


<small>A TEXT FROM GOETHE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jessica</span> had gone to bed a homesick, ashamed, discouraged
girl. She awoke, full of determination to conquer
all the difficulties of this &#8220;education&#8221; which had,
last night, seemed so formidable.</p>

<p>As she stood before her little mirror, brushing the
yellow curls into that semblance of order which was their
morning state, and that so soon gave place to a tangle
of glistening threads and escaping tendrils, she regarded
herself with severity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessica Trent, you may be going to be &#8216;one of the
richest&#8217; sometime, but at present you are a simpleton.
You&#8217;ve got everything before you&mdash;not a thing behind,
except&mdash;Well, except knowing how to ride a horse or
an ostrich, or hit a bull&#8217;s-eye, or a few other things that
Madame Mearsom would surely say were &#8216;unbefitting
a gentlewoman.&#8217; I used to love that word, hearing my
mother use it. I begin&mdash;I begin to hate it! Humph!
There goes, already! A gentlewoman doesn&#8217;t say &#8216;hate.&#8217;
But listen, you girl in the glass. I&#8217;m going to study so
hard I&#8217;ll catch up with that lowest &#8216;form&#8217; I&#8217;m not
clever enough to enter yet; and I&#8217;ll pass it by. Then I&#8217;ll
tackle the next one, and leave that behind. I&#8217;ll&mdash;get to
be the highest-up, intelligentest&mdash;that doesn&#8217;t sound right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
but you know what I mean, Jessica Trent. I&#8217;ll be the
head of the school, as Aubrey said that handsome Helen
Rhinelander is. I&#8217;ll take care to keep every rule and I&#8217;ll
find out what they are. And I&#8217;ll do it all for love&#8217;s
sake&mdash;for my mother! I made a bad beginning, but
&#8216;Little Captain,&#8217; hear me say I&#8217;m bound to make a good
ending. I WILL! Right here and now I&#8217;ll write that
poetry out, which Madame quoted from that Goethe. I
know who he was, my father had his books in his little
library. Maybe, who knows! it might have been that
very verse which encouraged dear father to go ahead
and start Sobrante and try to help so many people. He
believed he could &#8216;do&#8217; it and he did. I remember it
exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking a sheet of the school paper which was supplied
to each girl&#8217;s room, Jessica wrote in her very best
hand, and in that large size which would make the script
readable from every part of the room.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;What you can do, or think you can, begin it.</div>
<div class="verse">Boldness hath genius, power, and magic in it.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This she pinned to the mirror-frame, and, after her
brief devotions, she answered to the &#8220;assembly bell&#8221;
that summoned her to the hall below; and entered as
&#8220;boldly&#8221; as if her heart were not beating very fast and
her cheek glowing very red, meeting the curious gaze of
her schoolmates.</p>

<p>Of course, the news of her escapade and Madame&#8217;s
anxiety concerning the three absentees from last night&#8217;s
table had spread through all the forms.</p>

<p>Helen Rhinelander had emphasized the fact that &#8220;one
must expect such things from a wild Westerner and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
for her part, she felt Madame had made a great mistake
in admitting such a creature to the Adelphi. Pretty?
Well, yes, in a certain way; but no style. Not an atom
of style; and style was the one thing neither money nor
education could procure. It had to be born in a person,&#8221;
said Helen, with decision, and all her coterie chirped:
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Helen was but one, although her influence
held many. Also, there may be counter-influences even
more powerful than wealth and style. Along with the
discussion of last night&#8217;s affair was circulated by some
braver spirits, the fact that it was the young &#8220;Westerner&#8217;s&#8221;
cool sense which had extricated the trio from a
most unpleasant position, and that Madame was smiling
affectionately upon her, as she now crossed the hall to
the seat assigned her.</p>

<p>The smile which Jessica flashed back into that
motherly face expressed something of the thought she
had had while brushing her hair. At least, Madame,
long versed in the study of young girls&#8217; faces so interpreted
it; and now she not only smiled again but nodded
her white head in approval.</p>

<p>Prayers over, the family marched quietly out to breakfast,
that was as liberal in quantity and as faultlessly
served as it would have been in some big hostelry. A
small matter in itself, some might have said, but a detail
of infinite gain in the matter of the Adelphi&#8217;s success.
Also, an excellent equipment for the day&#8217;s study that
was to follow. &#8220;Healthy bodies make healthy minds&#8221;
was one of the schoolmistress&#8217;s maxims; a maxim nearly
always correct.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>After breakfast there came a half-hour of recreation,
passed usually in the garden or conservatory behind the
house. Then a silver bell struck the school hour and
each girl filed to her place at her own individual desk in
her own form class-room.</p>

<p>This was Jessica&#8217;s first glimpse of a time-regulated
household, and she was so absorbed in watching the
others that she scarcely realized she had been left behind,
alone, till a pleasant-faced teacher addressed her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Jessica, you are to be my &#8216;special&#8217; for the
present. I am Miss Montaigne. This way, please. We
are to have a cosy little spot quite to ourselves, for a
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning. I will try not to give you much
trouble, Miss Montaigne, but I am very stupid. I don&#8217;t
know anything, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more enjoyable then, to learn. I am so fond
of study myself that I fancy everybody else must be.
Sit here, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The place was but an alcove, opening into the lower
form class-room, but isolated from it sufficiently that what
went on within between teacher and pupil could not be
overheard. A very haven of comfort for Jessica, had
she been really as stupid as she felt; and one that soon
became to her the very dearest spot in all the great
building. In reality, she was now so eager to learn that
she could have &#8220;tackled,&#8221; as she called it, every branch
of study represented in the institution at once and altogether.
But Miss Montaigne would have none of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame has been a most successful instructor and
she allows no overcrowding. Two studies at a time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
with an &#8216;accomplishment&#8217; is her rule. We are to take
up arithmetic and spelling first. With music, or art, or
what your taste decides. Now, we&#8217;ll begin. This sum
in addition, if you please;&#8221; and the teacher pointed to
the very simplest possible.</p>

<p>Jessica glanced at it in contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;That? Why that&#8217;s far easier than making out the
&#8216;boys&#8217; wage-list. You must be teasing me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Beginning at the root of things. That&#8217;s
all. You may climb and grow as fast as Jack&#8217;s bean-stalk
if you wish. I&#8217;ll help push!&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, what a delightful person this Miss Montaigne
was! Almost as good as another girl to talk with, and
how like a game she made that &#8220;hated&#8221; arithmetic
seem. It <i>was</i> a game. Played so swiftly and eagerly between
these two that before either noticed how the time
was passing the recess hour was struck and&mdash;such a
babel of happy voices as followed it.</p>

<p>Desks were deserted, mates sought mates, Aubrey
alone mourned sorrowful in her corner, though Natalie
rushed into the alcove and whirled Jessica out of it, disputing
with somebody across the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mean, hateful girl! It is no such thing!
She isn&#8217;t! She&#8217;s a dear! Aren&#8217;t you, Jessica Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica returned the ardent hug she received with
another as fond, then holding Natalie off demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you quarreling with? What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That top-lofty Helen Rhinelander. She calls this
the &#8216;dunce&#8217;s corner&#8217; and that you wouldn&#8217;t have been
any more conspicuous if Madame had stood you on a
stool with a cap on your head. I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
matter with Helen. She&#8217;s hateful enough all the time
but she&#8217;s never been quite so unpleasant as since you,
came, yesterday. I&mdash;I wish she&#8217;d behave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. What&#8217;s more I&#8217;ll make her yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;Jessica! How can you?&#8221; asked the other
girl, astonished, as a group of schoolmates drew near,
anxious to know the &#8220;new-er&#8221; who had already so
stirred the quiet depths of the school.</p>

<p>There was a flash of &#8220;Little Captain&#8217;s&#8221; blue eyes, as
she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just how yet but I will. I&#8217;ll make her
so ashamed she&#8217;ll want to hide her head. Madame said
she was a real gentlewoman, and if she is her hatefulness
can&#8217;t be deep. I&#8217;ll conquer her by kindness, as my
mother says is the best way with ugly folks. That&#8217;s the
way she did a Chinese cook we had at Sobrante, and who
was&mdash;horrible. But he got over it. Nobody could be
nicer than Wun Lung is now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out into the garden. The &#8217;mums are just
beautiful now. Do you have chrysanthemums in California,
Jessica?&#8221; asked another girl, slipping her arm
about the stranger in such a friendly manner that Helen
Rhinelander&#8217;s coldness was forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Captain&#8221; had always won liking, wherever she
was known, because of her keen interest in other people
and her forgetfulness of self, nor did she fail now. One
by one, her fellow students, even from the higher forms,
gathered about the stranger, listening to her &#8220;Californian
talk&#8221;&mdash;a subject which made her tongue run glibly;
and so graphically did she describe life at Sobrante that
she made these New Yorkers envious of its freedom and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
constant sunshine. But not a word did she speak of her
prospective wealth; and, oddly enough, from this reticence
the notion spread that she was in reality a poor
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of Madame&#8217;s charity pupils. The daughter of a
former &#8216;Adelphian&#8217; who can&#8217;t afford to pay for her.
That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s dressed in such cheap stuff. Well,
she&#8217;s nice. She&#8217;s real nice, even if she is the &#8216;stupidest
girl in school,&#8217; and I shall treat her just the same as if
she were one of <i>us</i>,&#8221; said Rosalie Thorne, a sweet-faced
senior who was Helen&#8217;s rival for &#8220;honors&#8221; and was
greatly beloved of both teachers and mates. She was,
also, a very conscientious person and, perceiving Helen&#8217;s
attitude toward the &#8220;wild Westerner&#8221; set herself to use
her own influence in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Jessica&#8217;s coming had divided
the school into two factions; which promptly elected
themselves to be &#8220;Pros&#8221; and &#8220;Cons,&#8221; and beginning
with the toss of one haughty young head had grown like
that veritable &#8220;bean-stalk&#8221; to which Miss Montaigne
had smilingly referred.</p>

<p>But Jessica, the innocent cause of this disruption, took
it lightly. Sufficient for her the fact that there were
&#8220;Pros&#8221; enough to more than satisfy her longing for
&#8220;girls,&#8221; and that these were almost as admiringly affectionate
as even her &#8220;boys&#8221; at home. So, before many
hours passed she was so happy that &#8220;she almost felt
wicked,&#8221; remembering how desperately sad she had been
at parting with her mother. She even questioned
Madame Mearsom herself upon the subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Madame, is it right for me to be so glad? Is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
it like turning my back on mother and Cousin Margaret,
and all the rest of the grown-up folks? I&#8217;m not forgetting,
you know. I&#8217;m not really forgetting; only there
doesn&#8217;t seem to be room in my heart for sorrow and all
these good times together. This is the very first time
I ever lived with girls and I think&mdash;I think they are just
too delightful for words!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat Madame patted the little hand which had
stolen to her shoulder and answered, emphatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most certainly and entirely right. That is why
you are here&mdash;to be happy. I can send no more pleasing
message to Sobrante than that you are so &#8216;glad.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing alone really disturbed Jessica&#8217;s full content.
That was the peculiar behavior of Ephraim Marsh. Invariably,
when the day was fair enough for the &#8220;Adelphians&#8221;
to take their accustomed walks, &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
would appear on the opposite side of the same street. He
would march along, head erect, &#8220;eyes front,&#8221; as if keeping
step to some invisible band&mdash;his whole attitude as
correctly military as he could make it. Never, by any
possibility, did he recognize Jessica, nor answer to her
excited hand-salutes&mdash;the only sort she was permitted
on the street, or from that distance&mdash;and this hurt her
sadly. More than that, he never used his visitor&#8217;s privilege
of &#8220;once a week, on Thursdays, from four till
six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the other girls have their friends come to see
them, Ephy dear. Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her no explanation, simply said, each time:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see.&#8221; Not for anything would he have confessed
to her that his proud old heart had been offended by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Madame&#8217;s slowly pronounced reply to his question concerning
these visits, for which his own soul hungered
unspeakably. He only urged her to get leave to come to
the flat as often as she could, even though such calls
were as unsatisfactory as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you come without that teaching woman
tagged to you, &#8216;Little Captain,&#8217; not even once? I&#8217;d
come for you in a hired carriage and I&#8217;d pay the taxes
for it if it took my bottom dollar&mdash;which it wouldn&#8217;t.
I can&#8217;t half begin to use my wages, as a teacher myself,
and Sophia Badger Briggs being such an equonomical
housekeeper. I take Sophy posies, but I daren&#8217;t send
&#8217;em to you. Them windows to your &#8216;Adelphi&#8217; are always
chock full of flowers anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s a little conservatory, you know, in the
garden. Besides the girls&#8217; folks, the rich folks that have
always lived in New York, send flowers. They consider
it so &#8216;refining&#8217;; but, Ephy dear! I&#8217;d give all my year&#8217;s
allowance just for one dear, yellow California poppy,
instead of these &#8216;American Beauties&#8217; and orchids. Never
mind. We&#8217;ll be going home sometime and can gather
them for ourselves, and I am, I certainly am, very, very
happy. Why, Ephy! I&#8217;m learning so fast, I&#8217;ll be admitted
to the lowest form very, very soon. And I&#8217;m
taking fiddle lessons. I mean violin ones. I sing, too.
Madame says I have a very good &#8216;organ&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s something
in my throat, you know&mdash;though I&#8217;ll never equal
Gabriella! That&#8217;s mother. Gabriella was the &#8216;star pupil.&#8217;
She stood head of everything. Sometimes, when I
get pretty tired I feel as if it were dreadful to have to
live up to my mother! I don&#8217;t see why they don&#8217;t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
stars at both ends of the class, top and bottom; then I&#8217;d
be a star, myself, without any trouble. Ephraim Marsh,
did you know I was a dunce?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! No. Nor nobody knows it. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t so. If
you aren&#8217;t the smartest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ephy, it&#8217;s sadly, desperately true. The things I
don&#8217;t know would fill&mdash;would fill Madame&#8217;s &#8216;unabridged
dictionary!&#8217; I get almost discouraged, times; but I do
love to learn things. I love it. Only I can&#8217;t learn them
half fast enough. I want to get to be a &#8216;star&#8217; right
away quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was on one of Jessica&#8217;s brief visits to Granny
Briggs&#8217;s &#8220;apartment.&#8221; The girl had been corrected for
speaking of &#8220;flat.&#8221; Miss Montaigne who had accompanied
her special charge was reading a book she had
brought with her in the tiny front room, called the &#8220;parlor&#8221;
by the proud mistress of the little establishment.
In fact, she disliked her own present, enforced surveillance
of the trustworthy girl, who had grown up under
the faithful care of the old frontiersman; but Madame&#8217;s
rules were inflexible. Her young ladies must be attended
during such calls by some employee of her own.</p>

<p>Jessica suddenly remembered the young lady in the
parlor and pushed aside the plate of Indian pudding
which had been part of Granny&#8217;s &#8220;New England dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! dear! I suppose I must go now. Dear Ephy, do
stop that angry tramping up and down! The little dining-room
isn&#8217;t big enough for such a great old fellow as
you to go &#8216;rampagin&#8217; in. We&#8217;re going to school, both
of us, aren&#8217;t we? But, have patience, we&#8217;ll graduate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
sometime&mdash;with honors or without them, who knows?
And then we&#8217;ll go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe we will! Why, &#8216;Little Captain,&#8217; I&#8217;m
saving up again&#8217; it already. It shan&#8217;t cost anybody but
Ephraim Marsh, one single cent for all this coming and
going, these betwixts and betweens, and all the whole
enduring business of living in New York till we get
graddyated. Shucks! What&#8217;s Sophia Badger doing
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>What, indeed! Could that hospitable creature, who
had neither hesitated nor been ashamed once to offer her
last slice of bread to a chance visitor, could she do less
than hunt out her one plate which had a trifle of decoration
about it, and heaping it with the really delicious pudding
carry it into her parlor for Miss Montaigne&#8217;s
delectation?</p>

<p>Ephraim was aghast. He was more afraid of the prim
little &#8220;special&#8221; than even of the Madame herself, for the
younger woman wore &#8220;glasses&#8221; that magnified the eyes
behind them into something really formidable. Besides,
however she might lay aside austerity when with her
pupil, she assumed the most dignified of manners when
abroad.</p>

<p>That is, she had done so, heretofore. But Granny
Briggs&mdash;even the rule-encased schoolma&#8217;am could not
withstand her appealing face, encircled by its flapping
cap-ruffle; and with an apparent delight she graciously
accepted the pudding, murmuring her most correct
&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment the delight had ceased to be apparent
and had become real. One mouthful of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
&#8220;tasty&#8221; dessert proved that this was something quite
out of the common, and the pretty plate was not returned
to Granny till it was empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mrs. Briggs! That was so kind of you. Your
dainty has carried me back to the time when I went visiting
my own grandmother in your New England, and her
big kitchen with all its good things. I have enjoyed it
more than anything I have eaten for a long, long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a trivial matter in itself; but it was not
trivial in its results. Thereafter Miss Montaigne threw
all her influence to bear in giving Jessica more frequent
chances to meet her &#8220;humble friends,&#8221; as Madame called
them; and now and then to let her meet them as Ephraim
had desired, under his escort to and fro.</p>

<p>One thing delighted his soul. Late in the year Madame
added a riding academy to her school; or engaged one
for certain afternoons of each week. Here the sharpshooter
knew his darling would shine, and she did.</p>

<p>Yet her success seemed for a time but to increase the
unfriendliness of the &#8220;Con&#8221; side of the school. The
riding classes had been added by the solicitation of Helen
Rhinelander, already a fine horsewoman, who, during her
summer vacations had sometimes &#8220;ridden to hounds&#8221;
with some fashionable house-party. She loved riding
beyond all other exercise, and had been early taught.
She looked for no rival in the matter; but the very first
day, when Jessica had been admitted to the lesson, she
saw that she might be equalled, or even eclipsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl rides as if she were part of her horse. The
master gave her that fractious brute of his own, as soon
as she begged for it, thinking that the easiest way to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
take down her self-conceit; and meaning, of course, to
keep close beside her in case of a fall. Fall? The animal
couldn&#8217;t shake her off. He tried, forward and backward,
sidewise and every other wise, but she stuck like a
burr. The master was amazed. Soon he let go the
bridle and only watched&mdash;to be ready for accident. After
that he watched from sheer delight; and as soon as
she had made the circuit of the ring a few times and had
brought her mount down to a quiet pacing, he said:
&#8216;Miss Trent, I must congratulate you. I have nothing
to teach you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Jessica was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t let her stay in
the class, and asked him; and, of course, he said he was
only too proud of the honor. Then he questioned her and
found out that she had been put on a horse&#8217;s back before
she was out of baby-clothes and had to be held
there, while the horse was led around; and afterward&mdash;&#8216;Well,
afterward, I don&#8217;t remember much except a
horse, or sometimes a burro. One has to ride in California,
it&#8217;s so big, and wide, and places are so far apart;
and, oh! yes! I forgot! I can ride an ostrich, too. King
Zulu was the first one in America who was ever mounted,
so the &#8220;boys&#8221; claim. He is more fun even than the swiftest
horse; he&#8217;s faster, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy, Madame Mearsom, that girl talking away like
that to our reserved master! But he liked it. He liked
it so well, he even said: &#8216;I thought I had a magnificent
horsewoman in Miss Rhinelander, but Miss Trent, I
fear she will have to yield the palm to you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Rosalie! I&#8217;m sorry he said that,&#8221; answered
Madame, to whom Miss Thorne had given the above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
description. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about this division in the school&mdash;our
rival favorites; and though I have seemed to ignore
it, it has grieved me deeply. Helen is charming,
but for some unknown reason she appears to have taken
a dislike to Jessica. I am very, very sorry. There should
be no rivalry or jealousy between those two. They are
not of the same age, they differ in all respects&mdash;I mean
are so unlike one another&mdash;they ought to be the best of
friends. Do what you can, dear Rosalie, to bridge this
difference. I wish something would happen to settle
the matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something <i>was</i> to happen; but the anxious schoolmistress
could not foresee that it would be in the nature of
a tragedy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br />


<small>THE SOMETHING WHICH HAPPENED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> solace her daughter for her chagrin in being outclassed
by Jessica, Mrs. Rhinelander gave her a new
horse; as handsome a creature as could be found and
&#8220;warranted kind and true.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the other girls envied Helen her &#8220;Beauty,&#8221; except
the &#8220;Little Captain,&#8221; now rapidly developing into
an excellent scholar, and with her love of learning increasing
all the time. She was ambitious to be that
&#8220;star&#8221;&mdash;at the top not bottom of the school&mdash;and all
the energy of her ardent nature was put into this work.
The result of this was that, despite all prescribed rules
for exercise and recreation, Jessica grew thin and somewhat
careworn.</p>

<p>Ephraim was swift to observe this and to devise some
plan for remedying it. He could think of nothing better
than to send home to the &#8220;boys&#8221; for the &#8220;finest four-footed
creatur&#8217; in all Paraiso d&#8217;Oro.&#8221; So he wrote, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;The head girl to our &#8216;Lady&#8217;s&#8217; school has been
give as purty a brute as ever I laid eyes on, and &#8216;Little
Captain&#8217;s&#8217; has got to beat it. Now, Samson and John
Benton, you put your heads together and finish up the
job and express the creatur&#8217; &#8217;long, double quick. Our
girl isn&#8217;t going to be down-sot, in the matter of horse-flesh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
by any trumpery New Yorker, and you see to it.
There&#8217;s horses here, course, and good ones; but no beast
that hasn&#8217;t breathed the superfine air of Californy is fit
for our &#8216;Lady.&#8217; Mum&#8217;s the word till I get your telegrapht
that &#8216;Sobrante&#8217; has arrived, and then I&#8217;ll put in
my full share of the bill. I&#8217;m getting a new &#8216;livery&#8217;
made, same as Madam Dalrymple had me wear and &#8217;t
made me feel such a fool, first time. But if I&#8217;m to
be &#8216;groom&#8217; to anybody, at my time of life, and it&#8217;ll
make things a mite nicer for my girl, I&#8217;ll wear it,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve hung around that riding-school where they&#8217;re tryin&#8217;
to teach Jessie what she&#8217;s known always, and I&#8217;ve
made friends with the work folks. More&#8217;n that, &#8216;Little
Lady&#8217; has pointed me out to the master as her teacher at
Sobrante, and he spoke to me as slick as molasses. Said
I&#8217;d a pupil to be proud of and I &#8217;lowed I had. Then,
&#8217;cause she was so pleased to have me &#8217;round, he up and
asked me to ride with his classes in the Park, whenever
I had a mind. And don&#8217;t you doubt but that&#8217;ll be every
time they go out, soon&#8217;s I learn what days it will be.
And I cast an observin&#8217; eye on the outfit of his &#8216;assistants&#8217;
and I&#8217;m getting my own to match. I cal&#8217;late the
next thing he&#8217;ll be doing will be to ask me to help
&#8216;assist,&#8217; and that&#8217;ll be something worth while. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t
be on account of wages, neither, but just for the honor
of Californy, to show him how an eighty-year-old can sit
a horse, rheumatiz or nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, don&#8217;t let no grass grow under that horse&#8217;s hoofs
till he&#8217;s shipped direct; and take it to your hearts that
you&#8217;ll be doing the square thing by the girl we all love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
if you &#8217;tend to this here business with neatness and despatch.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Yours, till death and his exile ends,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Ephraim Marsh</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It was but a little more than two weeks later that, on
a certain Thursday, &#8220;between four and six,&#8221; Jessica had
a visitor.</p>

<p>The liveried colored man who admitted the stranger
had doubts as to whether he should have done so, since
the caller also wore a livery, though one not adorned by
brass buttons.</p>

<p>However, Ephraim marched boldly in and selecting a
chair which commanded the entrance sat down to wait
with what patience he could till Miss Trent should appear.
Other visitors were there, in the great room, and
other pupils; all casting rather amused glances toward
&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; and wondering how such a social blunder
had been permitted as his admission into those exclusive
precincts. Possibly, the old man might have been
abashed, had he observed these glances, but he did not.
He saw nothing, heard nothing, till a beloved footstep
sounded swiftly through the hall, and at a pace less
decorous than Madame liked, Jessica came bounding
into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, you darling Ephraim! you did come at last, didn&#8217;t
you! How dear of you! And you see it isn&#8217;t bad.
Now you&#8217;ll come every Thursday won&#8217;t you? But&mdash;but,
Ephy! How funny you look! Why have you got
such a queer, brown suit? Riding boots, leggings,&mdash;you&#8217;re
exactly like one of the grooms at the academy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
What notion possessed you? But never mind. I&#8217;m so
glad, so glad to have you; and I would be even in your
old overalls from the gardening last summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica sat down close to her faithful friend but she
couldn&#8217;t repress her amusement, the frontiersman was so
uncomfortable in his new attire, yet so full of suppressed
excitement. With another smile she demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do explain, Ephy. If you wanted new clothes why
didn&#8217;t you get Mr. Hale, or somebody who knows what&#8217;s
correct, to advise you? Even I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, &#8216;Captain.&#8217; Come over to that window, yonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>With his hat in his hand, he led the way across the
room and pointing outward, demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that there bay horse, that boy is leading
up and down? &#8216;All saddled and bridled and fit for a
Prince&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I see him. What a perfectly beautiful animal!
See him, now! What knee action! What a neck!
What shapely legs! Whoever owns that creature knows
the &#8216;points&#8217; of a fine horse. Is it somebody&#8217;s you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low it is. I &#8217;low she does&mdash;know points. She&#8217;d
ought to, being as she was raised on &#8217;em, so to speak;
and if you hadn&#8217;t re<i>cog</i>nized them I&#8217;d have been plumb
disappointed. For the creatur&#8217;s <i>yours</i>! Arrived last
night, overland, straight from the &#8216;boys&#8217; at Sobrante,
named &#8216;Sobrante&#8217; himself, and waiting this minute for
his new owner and mistress to try his paces with me as
&#8216;attendant.&#8217; That&#8217;s why this pesky livery. That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;ve come. That&#8217;s why you go ask your Madame, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
once, if you can&#8217;t go for a canter in the Park if I&#8217;ll wager
my own neck I&#8217;ll fetch you home safe, any time she
names!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s cry of delight was almost a scream. So
&#8220;unladylike,&#8221; in fact, that a caller near by elevated her
eyebrows and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What astonishing things! That groom, that ill-bred
girl, I am surprised at Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s nothing. She&#8217;s our wild westerner, you
know. One may expect any sort of behavior from her,&#8221;
replied the young lady addressed, a &#8220;Con&#8221; of the most
decided sort, and an admiring follower of the handsome
Helen.</p>

<p>However, Jessica had become inured to this kind of remark,
which she happened to overhear, and though it
didn&#8217;t add to her pleasure it did not greatly detract from
it. Indeed, her heart was beating so high at thought of
her dear &#8220;boys&#8217;&#8221; remembrance of her that she could
scarcely keep her feet from dancing; but she tried to remember
Madame Mearsom&#8217;s expressed desires, and with
a low: &#8220;Come this way!&#8221; to Ephraim, she led him out of
the reception room to a smaller one at the end of the hall,
where tradesmen sometimes waited an interview with the
mistress of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is quieter, Ephy, and we&#8217;re quite by ourselves.
Wait just a minute. Madame is going out this afternoon
but I&#8217;ll run and ask that permission. If she&#8217;ll only give
it! How happy, how happy we will be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Already there was a glow upon the cheeks that had
been paler than of old and &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; felt he had
acted wisely and well. Also, because of Jessica&#8217;s good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
record in her work and the eagerness in her face,
Madame was graciously pleased to give the coveted
permission and to add her congratulations on the fine
gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hours, only, from the time of leaving till you are
back at the door, remember, my dear. And I hope, I
certainly hope, you will have a most delightful ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the windows of the reception room some watched
the &#8220;Westerner&#8221; ride away and wondered at the ease
with which she mounted and assumed control of an untried
mount, one that was as restless and inexperienced
in city surroundings as this beautiful creature from the
plains.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Ephy! I feel almost, almost as if we were at home
again, starting for a long, long ride&mdash;to Dr. Kimball&#8217;s, or
some other far-away neighbors. If I didn&#8217;t have to wear
this tight skirt I&#8217;d feel exactly like. Oh! how well he
suits me! His back is perfect. They couldn&#8217;t have
chosen better&mdash;You dear Sobrante! I&#8217;d like to hug you,
and I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word Jessica leaned forward
and clasped the horse&#8217;s beautiful, arched neck, sending a
thrill of pleasure through his equine heart. But another
sort of thrill instantly followed. An automobile whizzed
honking by and Sobrante promptly stood upon his hind
feet.</p>

<p>Spectators along the avenue halted in fear. The girlish
rider would certainly be thrown! Only she nor
Ephraim showed no alarm. He merely checked the hired
animal he bestrode and which he had taken care should
be the best in its owner&#8217;s stable, and watched. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
ready to clasp Sobrante&#8217;s bridle, should that be necessary,
and to use his man&#8217;s strength to bring the animal to subjection.
However, this was not required.</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s own fearlessness inspired her sensitive mount
with confidence. Her whispered soothing words penetrated
his consciousness and his affectionate nature responded
to her love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but an &#8216;auty,&#8217; Sobrante dear! Foolish
things, they are not to be compared with such as you, my
beauty; but plenty as can be. You&#8217;ll get used to them,
directly. They can&#8217;t hurt you. Nothing shall hurt you,
precious! Just hold your head high and proud, and disdain
to look at them, you splendid fellow. Once we are
in the Park, we&#8217;ll get to the quietest place and&mdash;Go!
That is, we&#8217;ll pretend to go&mdash;but it won&#8217;t be as we could
at home. Steady, there, pet. Here comes another
&#8216;goose&#8217; on four wheels!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sobrante curveted and pranced, bowed his beautiful
head, tossed it up and down, showed every symptom of
that &#8220;disdain&#8221; she requested but&mdash;did <i>not</i> rise upon his
hind legs. After that, with each succeeding moment,
nearly, one of the offending, snorting monsters passed
them by or met them face to face; and by the time they
had entered the Park gates he had become familiar with
at least one phase of the city streets.</p>

<p>Both Ephraim and Jessica were delighted with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just as intelligent&mdash;as he looks! Some horses
aren&#8217;t, you know. And as handsome as he is wise. Oh!
He&#8217;s just perfect. He&#8217;s far and away finer than that new
&#8216;Beauty&#8217; of Helen Rhinelander&#8217;s. &#8216;Beauty&#8217; is true to
his name, course, but I don&#8217;t like his eye. He shows the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
white of it too much; and though he pretends he doesn&#8217;t
mind autos, isn&#8217;t a bit afraid of them, he is. Down in his
heart he is. I&#8217;ve watched him while we were out here in
the Park. I think the master doesn&#8217;t wholly trust that
horse, either; else he wouldn&#8217;t ride so close to Helen and
leave one of his assistants to attend the beginners who
need most care.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to think, Ephy dear! I shan&#8217;t have to ride a
hired horse again! And I can hardly wait for to-morrow
and our regular lesson. All the &#8216;Pros&#8217; will be delighted
with Sobrante; and I&#8217;d be glad to share him with them,
if I were allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, &#8216;Captain,&#8217; not yet. You&#8217;ve got to let
him learn you, first, so he would mind your voice even
with somebody else in his saddle. And I&#8217;ll be on hand.
My shucks! But it will seem like old times for us to be
riding together just as we used! Get up there, you slow
poke! I&#8217;ve a mind to send home again for a creatur&#8217; of
my own! Then I&#8217;d be fixed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica said nothing to this; but all at once she appeared
anxious for their return. So they wheeled about
and arrived at the &#8216;Adelphi&#8217; in such good time that
Madame was greatly pleased and promised another outing
for these two alone.</p>

<p>But Jessica&#8217;s haste was not so much due to her obedience
as to a notion that had entered her head when Ephraim
spoke. If one horse could be shipped safely from
Sobrante, why not two? So she spent the remainder of
that recreation afternoon in writing to her mother and
asking for &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; a similar gift to her own.
Also, in due time the letter was answered by the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of another steed. Not quite so fine as Sobrante but far
finer than any the sharpshooter could hire at the ordinary
livery-stable; and when received his own delight was as
great as Jessica&#8217;s had been. He had been sorely perplexed
between his longing for the animal and his sense
of right. He hated debt, as had all his old employer&#8217;s
household. He must save to pay expenses during his
life in New York, while his little lady was achieving
that education she desired, and for his trip home again
when that education was accomplished. He would not
receive a gift of money from Mrs. Trent, and Jessica&#8217;s
&#8220;allowance&#8221; was most modest&mdash;also, generally used up
to the last cent from quarter to quarter. But a gift of a
horse&mdash;that was quite another matter; and it added to the
old man&#8217;s health as well as his pleasure.</p>

<p>But long before that letter was far on its way the hour
had arrived for the riding class to take their trip to the
Park. It was the custom on such occasions for the
horses to be brought to the Adelphi and the young
ladies to start from there, with the attendant master and
his assistant teachers. This time when they assembled,
Helen Rhinelander first saw Sobrante, and Ephraim was
gratified by the envious look she cast on the animal and
on its graceful rider.</p>

<p>Reining her own &#8220;Beauty&#8221; up to Jessica&#8217;s side, she
inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that your own horse, Miss Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! Isn&#8217;t he a dear? The &#8216;boys&#8217; sent him,&#8221;
returned Sobrante&#8217;s mistress, pleased to be noticed even
thus much by the haughty senior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. He is&mdash;quite handsome. But, if he&#8217;s been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
reared in the&mdash;the wilds, you&#8217;ll have trouble with him.
You should be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. But there&#8217;ll be no trouble. I&#8217;ve had
him out once already and though he didn&#8217;t like the automobiles,
at first, he got so he despised them after a little
while. He thinks elevated trains are dreadful but&mdash;he&#8217;s
as obedient as a horse can be. He knows me already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd! That would be according him human
intelligence, which no four-footed beast possesses. Don&#8217;t
be too confident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there was nothing that would sooner arouse Jessica&#8217;s
quick temper than disparagement of horses; and
she flashed back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, some horses do possess it&mdash;or its equivalent.
Why, I could tell you things about Sobrante animals that
would amaze you, if you didn&#8217;t know they were true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And because you told them I suppose I <i>should</i> know
that!&#8221; retorted Helen sarcastically. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard
of &#8216;California stories&#8217; and I&#8217;m not anxious for them.
Only, take care. I&#8217;ve ridden for several years and I
know horses are not to be trusted till after you&#8217;ve used
them a long time. Even Beauty, here, is restless and I
have to watch him all the time. He is intelligent, if you
please, extraordinarily so, but he hasn&#8217;t yet learned to
&#8216;despise&#8217; an auto, after all these weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is intelligent&mdash;to a degree. Not like Sobrante,
though; and if you&#8217;ve ridden for years I&#8217;ve ridden
all my life. It is you who need warning. That Beauty
is in a vicious mood, to-day. There is evil in his eye.
Yes, I am ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this response to the master&#8217;s question: &#8220;Ready,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
young ladies?&#8221; Jessica fell into line, Ephraim beside
her, the proudest man in the whole cavalcade, even
though mounted on a beast the &#8220;boys&#8221; would have
laughed at. But, as he had once ridden &#8220;Stiffleg&#8221; from
love of that beast he now bestrode this hired hack from
affection for his &#8220;Little Captain,&#8221; who was growing so
fast she was outstripping that adjective &#8220;Little.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master himself took his place beside Helen Rhinelander,
and to that young horsewoman this was both
pleasing and displeasing. It was flattering to be singled
out as the only one of the class worthy such attention;
yet, on the other hand, it suggested to onlookers that it
was a case of precaution.</p>

<p>Beauty was certainly in an ugly mood. He fretted at
the touch of her hand on the bridle, he acted as if he
would like to take the bit in his teeth, and bolt; and to
three of the party, at least, the arrival at the quieter Park
was vast relief. These three were the master, the sharpshooter,
and Jessica Trent. To these three a fine horse
meant something higher than a servant or a beast of burden;
he was a creature of keen perceptions and strong
emotions.</p>

<p>That morning, Beauty had been roughly groomed.
This was unusual and painfully trying to his sensitive
skin and temper. Then his saddle had been found defective
in some slight way and another which did not fit
had been substituted. Other stable happenings had been
unfortunate, and Beauty took the road far from fit to be
trusted with so valuable a burden as Helen Rhinelander.</p>

<p>However, for a time, after entering the Park, he
seemed to forget his worries, as his young mistress presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
forgot hers. To those who love it, there is nothing
more exhilarating than a swift canter on a fresh spring
morning, such as this; and the spirits of the whole party
rose to the highest.</p>

<p>Suddenly from a side road, at a wild rate of speed,
rushed a runaway automobile, tenantless, chauffeurless,
tearing its own unguided way into the very midst of the
horseback cavalcade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ware! Ware!&#8221; warned the master, shrieked the
grooms; while Ephraim would have planted himself
directly in the path of the oncoming monster had not Jessica
reached forward, seized his horse&#8217;s bridle and jerked
him aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephy! you can&#8217;t stop it! Look out, look out! O
Helen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Beauty, like Ephraim, had planted himself in the way.
For an instant he stood stock still, while the glaring red
machine rushed toward his very front. The next he had
reared and plunged and Helen was almost unseated.</p>

<p>What happened after that there were some who could
not see, for they had closed their eyes against an inevitable
tragedy.</p>

<p>But Jessica saw, comprehended, acted. With one toss
of her own bridle into Ephraim&#8217;s outstretched hand she
was on the ground, had caught that of the frenzied
Beauty and swerved him out of the road, Helen still
clinging frightened but unharmed to her saddle. The
next instant the automobile had dashed onward out of
sight, but a girl in a blue habit lay huddled on the ground,
a torn and bruised object from which they turned away
their eyes, not daring to look upon her fair, brave face&mdash;so
ghastly white and quiet now.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />


<small>RECONCILIATION AND REVELATION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Ephraim who first recovered himself.</p>

<p>Leaping from his horse, he flung both bridles to any
hand would catch them and with a strength and agility
due eighteen rather than eighty years, he lifted his unconscious
&#8220;Little Captain&#8221; in his arms and ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ambulance! St. Luke&#8217;s hospital!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he tenderly laid Jessica&#8217;s bleeding cheek against
his shoulder, and with shaking hand did his utmost to
stanch the flow of blood. For a moment he did not even
weep, then the tears coursed down his bronzed face till
they blinded him.</p>

<p>The whole party had gathered at a small distance,
silent, stunned, unbelieving that such a dreadful thing
could have happened, and to her the most unselfish, most
innocent of them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;She gave her life to save the girl who hated her!&#8221;
sobbed Rosalie Thorne, and again turned her eyes
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look&mdash;look&mdash;at Helen! She seems&mdash;as if she were
marble!&#8221; whispered another, feeling that even that subdued
murmur were sacrilege.</p>

<p>The clang of an ambulance bell broke in on that silence
and, as he had done once before, poor old Ephraim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
mounted the steps at its rear and followed his darling
to her fate.</p>

<p>He had not heart for hope left in him. Girls could not
twice escape such peril and live. His &#8220;Little Captain&#8221;
was done for, she would see her beloved home no more;
and again, as he had often felt, he realized that her coming
east at all had been a grievous mistake. Then a
strange feeling of exultation that he should be the only
one of her &#8220;boys&#8221; who had followed her to the death
rose within him and when he realized it, frightened him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as if I was glad&mdash;&#8217;t she&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s&mdash;Hold on there,
Ephraim Marsh! While there&#8217;s life there&#8217;s hope and if&mdash;if
&#8217;twas so&mdash;she&#8217;d&mdash;there wouldn&#8217;t have been this on
that!&#8221; he considered, holding before him the handkerchief
he had pressed to Jessica&#8217;s cheek, now so sadly
stained with red.</p>

<p>Of course, Jessica was not dead. Had she been, this
story would have ended then and there; but for a long
time her young life swayed in the balance and the skill of
the best was brought to her aid. Her mother was notified,
for a time by hourly telegrams, then by daily ones,
of her exact condition; and that she did not immediately
hasten to her daughter&#8217;s side was that she had herself
suffered an accident of a broken limb and was helpless
on her back.</p>

<p>Ned and Luis had disappeared up the canyon and as
they had before&mdash;imperilled their lives in the mines&mdash;so
now a presentiment of danger to them had sent her in
pursuit. An unwary step, a loosened bit of rock, and her
search was ended. She was carried home by the miners,
two sadly repentant youngsters in her train, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
time so discreet was their behavior that the ranch mistress
could scarcely regret her own mischance which had
brought this improvement about.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_192.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;It isn&#8217;t like a real hunchback, you know: only you were let fall when you<br />
were little and got twisted somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gap">(See page <a href="#Page_112">112</a>)</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, Aunt Sally, aided by Cousin Margaret,
was able to dispel much of the mother&#8217;s anxiety; and
when the news came that the girl was &#8220;out of danger&#8221;
the former made a great feast and, preparing all the
ranchmen by a preliminary dose of &#8220;medicine&#8221; for any
possible ill results, celebrated the event in royal style.</p>

<p>Then she sat down and wrote a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear little Jess</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Ma has broke her leg, and a fine thing too.
Nothin&#8217; short of broke bones would have set them two
boys on the road to Good-ville. Sence then they&#8217;ve been
next door to saints. Ain&#8217;t hooked none of my pies nor
browbeat Wun Lung. I made a supper for the &#8216;boys&#8217;
and all the rest the men-folks, and I tell you I made
Wunny cook for all he was worth. I picry-ed &#8217;em all
&#8217;round, first, so as to carry off any indigestion they might
get, over-eating, and it done &#8217;em good. Even though my
son John did say &#8217;t he seen the most of &#8217;em fling it on
the ground, &#8217;stead of into their stummicks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re to that hospital, where that Sophy
girl is; and &#8217;twon&#8217;t do you a mite of harm to rest up a
little from that studying. Too much book learning never
did set well on a Trent&#8217;s digesters and Ephraim Ma&#8217;sh, he
wrote John that you&#8217;d been kind of peaked. So &#8217;twon&#8217;t
hurt you. Tell them hospital folks that if they&#8217;d admire
to have one my rising-sun or log-cabin quilts I&#8217;d admire
just as much to send &#8217;em. And I&#8217;ll piece as many more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
as they&#8217;ll furnish the patches for. I spoke of that to
Mis&#8217; Dalrymple and all she did was laugh in that slow,
ladylike way of hern. She&#8217;s real nice, Mis&#8217; Dalrymple
is. Me and her has real good times a-comparin&#8217; notes
about what used to be and isn&#8217;t no more. I can see, easy
as fiddlin&#8217;, where &#8217;tis your Ma gets her politeness. She
was raised by Margaret Dalrymple; and you was raised
by your Ma; and I do hope to goodness, Jessie Trent,
that you&#8217;ll try to do them credit. Neither don&#8217;t you go
flinging yourself against them ortymo<i>beels</i>, that fool
folks have hatched out of their brains, these last years.
I seen one. If you&#8217;ll believe me, girlie, one of &#8217;em come
whizzing onto this very ranch of Sobrante only last week
that ever was. It was chock full of towerists and it
scared the ranch horses into fits. But, worse and more of
it. They fair set Ninian Sharp wild to own one hisself.
He&#8217;s makin&#8217; real good wages now, Ninian is, a-managin&#8217;
the mines; and he seems to want every new-fangled thing
a-going. Him with a world full of horses, and I thought
he had more sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sending you by express&mdash;John pays the
cost&mdash;a box of home-made guava jelly, some fresh figs,
some oranges, some&mdash;Well, I reckon a little of &#8216;some&#8217;
everything &#8217;t I could think of that would keep on so long
a road. John, he says you could buy &#8217;em all better and
cheaper right there in that New York city than it&#8217;ll cost
to send this box. But I know better. Anyhow I know
none bought there would begin to taste as nice to you
as these right from Sobrante. You may be gettin&#8217; a terrible
smart scholard, as Ephraim Ma&#8217;sh he wrote, but you&#8217;ll
never get to be anything except a girl that loves her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
home and her folk better than anything else in the world.
Bless you, my lamb! there ain&#8217;t a night nor day that I
don&#8217;t go down on my old hunkies&mdash;I mean knees&mdash;and
ask the Good Father to take special care of you, His
fatherless child. There&#8217;s many a heart aches for you, deary,
and many an eye will shine&mdash;and cry, too&mdash;when
that day comes that fetches you home. I&#8217;ve made up my
mind to quit &#8216;Boston,&#8217; to coax my silly, sick cousin to
come out here and we&#8217;ll build her a little bungalow to
live in. &#8216;Bungalow&#8217; is the new-fangled name they&#8217;re
getting here in Californy for just plain house, or cottage.
The world thinks it&#8217;s growin&#8217; powerful smart, don&#8217;t it?
There&#8217;s doin&#8217;s here, too, I tell you. We&#8217;ve got a regular
village of houses for the miners, started already. You
won&#8217;t know Sobrante when you get back to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. It won&#8217;t be more&#8217;n three or four years,
now, for you have been gone one already. Just think!
A whole endurin&#8217; year, and you&#8217;ve been burned to death,
and ortymo<i>beel</i>ed to death, and got lost on the streets,
and land knows what hasn&#8217;t happened. But I&#8217;m thankful
for the good word that come to-day; how you&#8217;ll soon be
back to that big school. Your Ma says that the teacher
is going to take you and some the other scholards to
camp out in the Airondacks this summer. I&#8217;m glad of
it. I don&#8217;t justly know what Airondacks, or Airydondacks,
or whatever &#8217;tis are. But I sort of sense that
they&#8217;re partly woods and partly water and partly mountings.
Them three parts put together, and you sleeping
right outdoors in a tent&mdash;What do they do when it rains?&mdash;will
make it seem most like Californy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now no more till next time. I&#8217;d admire to put a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
bottle or so of picry or somethin&#8217; in the box but John he
won&#8217;t hear to it. He says&mdash;No, I shan&#8217;t repeat what he
says. Not to a girl like you, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s so sort of onrespectful.
I know you&#8217;ll be glad to know I&#8217;ve got four
more quilts ready pieced and fit to put on the quiltin&#8217;-frames.
When them are done and I get two&mdash;three more
done I&#8217;ll nigh have reached my hundred limit, what I
set for myself. John says what in&mdash;I mean he says what
does anybody want of a hundred quilts, here in Californy
with a summer climate all the year round. But John, he
don&#8217;t know everything, even if he thinks he does.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is &#8216;good-by&#8217; for sure, this time. I&#8217;ve got to stop
writin&#8217; and talkin&#8217; to you&mdash;as it seems like&mdash;&#8217;cause there&#8217;s
some sort of goings-on out in Wunny&#8217;s kitchen. I cal&#8217;late
them childern has been into some his messes and I can&#8217;t
let Gabriell&#8217; hear &#8217;em, for it would make her fidget.
Everybody sends love, and don&#8217;t forget to tell the hospital
folks about the rising-sun and log-cabin.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Your loving, foolish, hungry-for-you,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Aunt Sally</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This letter was duly read by the nurse who had charge
of Jessica to her convalescent, and as attentively listened
to by Sophy, Ephraim, and even Granny Briggs, herself.
It was visitors&#8217; day and &#8220;Little Captain&#8221; was so far recovered
that these now happy, cheerful callers could not
harm her by the fatigue of conversation. The others
laughed over it, enjoyed it, and even the sharpshooter
somewhat ridiculed it.</p>

<p>Upon which, quoth &#8220;Sophia Badger, that was:&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Ephraim Marsh, you ain&#8217;t half as smart as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
think. I take that letter for just what it&#8217;s worth&mdash;right
out of the heart of one the best women the Lord ever
made. From all you&#8217;ve told me about her before, and
what her own letter tells itself, I&#8217;d &#8216;admire&#8217; myself to
know her. She may be queer&mdash;so are you. I&#8217;m like the
old Quaker who said: &#8216;All the world&#8217;s queer except thee
and me, Hannah, and even thee&#8217;s a little queer sometimes.&#8217;
We can&#8217;t see ourselves and our own queernesses. A good
thing, too; but I wish there were a lot more &#8216;Aunt
Sallies&#8217; scattered around the world, brightening it and
dosing it and keeping it wholesome. Think what a difference
&#8217;twould have made to Sophy and me if there&#8217;d been
an &#8216;Aunt Sally&#8217; living in Avenue A when we were starving
there. No, Ephraim Marsh, you always were a
light-headed kind of boy and you never have grown up.
So, don&#8217;t let me hear no more fun-making of that good
woman in Californy, that I&#8217;d admire to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus strictly corrected the dame, who had fully assumed
charge of her old playmate&#8217;s mind and morals.</p>

<p>To divert attention from her beloved sharpshooter, Jessica
cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you <i>shall</i> know Aunt Sally, Mrs. Briggs! And
you are right; she <i>is</i> one of the best women in the world.
I don&#8217;t know what my dear mother would ever have done
without her. In all her troubles and worries, mother
has turned to Aunt Sally, and has always found help.
So, when we go home; when Sophy, too, has finished her
nurse&#8217;s training and got her diploma; we&#8217;ll <i>all</i> go home
together. Sophy is to be superintendent of the hospital
mother is to have built and we&#8217;ll none of us who love
each other be separated again, never again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>&#8220;Oh! the dreams I&#8217;ve had, the plans I&#8217;ve formed, lying
here just getting well. Seems if my whole life long and
every dollar that comes into my hands must go to make
somebody happy. Somebody&mdash;no matter who&mdash;just the
somebody that comes nearest and the happiness can reach
the first. Life&mdash;it makes a girl think pretty seriously
when she knows that just the tiniest bit more of a bruise
or a cut would have ended that life. It seems as if I
must hurry, hurry, to make up to somebody for any mischance
has come to them. I&mdash;&mdash;Beg pardon, nurse, what
did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That these visitors have stayed their full time; that
Sophy must be taken back to her own place; and that
there is one more visitor wishing to see you. I think
you have had enough callers as it is, but this one has
been here nearly every day, inquiring, though not before
asking permission to come up to your room. I think
she is one of your schoolmates, and you must not expect
to keep her long. Nor do you talk much. Let her talk
and you just listen and she must not stay long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others made their prompt adieus and departed;
Jessica remarking: &#8220;I think it must be Rosalie Thorne.
She&#8217;s been so kind and sympathetic. I don&#8217;t see how she
has given so much time to calling, when she&#8217;s working so
hard for her last examination. Only another week and
then Commencement. Oh! I hope I may be &#8216;discharged&#8217;
by that time, so I can see the girls in their pretty frocks
and their flowers and their pride. Helen and Rosalie are
honor girls, I know. Poor Helen. I wish she would
learn to like me just a little bit before she goes away forever.
She&#8217;s to live in Europe, Madame said, and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
herself in music. At least, to go on with it, though nobody
can ever &#8216;perfect&#8217; himself I suppose. Poor Helen!
How near, how near she came to losing her own life that
day! I remember I warned her about that Beauty.
He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, my little patient. That&#8217;s quite enough &#8216;remembering&#8217;
for now. What I want you to do is some
forgetting, if you please, of all that is past and gone.
Think! in another week you will be back at school, well
and happy once more. Ah! here comes a maid with the
young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was sitting in her pretty chair, but rose as the
caller entered; then promptly settled back again, while
her outstretched arm sank slowly to her side. She was
still weak enough to be unnerved by the sight of Helen
Rhinelander whom her visitor proved to be and whom
she had not seen since they two faced death together.
Nor was she at all prepared for the strange behavior of
the haughty senior, who hesitated on the threshold of the
room, cast one glance toward the nurse&mdash;as if wishing
that person elsewhere&mdash;then hurriedly crossed to Jessica&#8217;s
chair and sank on her knees beside it.</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s face was streaming with repentant tears and
her voice tremulous with profound emotion as she caught
up Jessica&#8217;s still-bandaged hand and kissed it humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Jessica, you savior of my life! Will you forgive
me? Can you ever, ever learn to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The&mdash;savior&mdash;Helen&mdash;Why, what can you mean?
Why do you kneel? Why are you crying? Oh! don&#8217;t
please. Please, please, don&#8217;t! It seems so queer&mdash;as if
things were all coming to an end to have you kneel there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and ask me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;to &#8216;forgive you.&#8217; What in the world
have I to forgive? It&#8217;s I should be forgiven, for I was
angry. I was fearful angry that day, because you
slighted Sobrante and praised Beauty. I&mdash;Yes, nurse. I
know. I won&#8217;t talk about it, only long enough to make
dear Helen understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain enough then that Jessica either did not
know how brave her own action had been nor that all her
recent suffering had been the price of saving her enemy&#8217;s
life. Understanding this, the nurse delicately slipped
away, leaving those two young souls to find out the
truth from one another and to make that peace which
their words signified had not existed between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessica, don&#8217;t you know? Is it possible that nobody
has told you how your flinging yourself upon that vicious
Beauty prevented his trampling me under his feet
and surely saved my life? He trampled you instead and
I feel&mdash;I feel&mdash;O Jessica! I have been so mean, so little,
so dastardly and hateful all along from the beginning. I
can&#8217;t tell you how mean I feel. Can you forgive me?
<i>Can you</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, Helen! Let&#8217;s change the question. Can you
love me a little, tiny bit? That&#8217;s all I want in this world
to be loved; or what&#8217;s better, be let to love other people
just as much as I wish. You are so beautiful, so clever,
I&#8217;ve just longed to love you, only&mdash;only&mdash;Say, Helen,
that you can and will now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The senior&#8217;s answer was to clasp the convalescent in
such a close embrace as satisfied forever Jessica&#8217;s longing
in that question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love you, &#8216;Little Captain&#8217;? Oh! with all my heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and soul; and to try to be somewhat like you is now my
dearest ambition. Kiss me, Jessie, kiss me once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not only kisses but tears commingled, to that extent
the watchful nurse from the room beyond came back to
her post and cut the interview short. But it was a very
different, most radiant Helen who left that hospital room
and repaired with her story and her good news to the
motherly presence of Madame Mearsom.</p>

<p>When she had finished that narration, she added:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, Madame, I want you to help me find a way
to, at least, partially repay Jessica for her suffering. I
know about hospitals. That it is very expensive to have
a private room and one &#8216;special&#8217; nurse, even one; yet
Jessica has had two, and sometimes three. That means,
I suppose, that she has been in extremest danger. I want
to help her. Will you find out for me, and arrange it as
only your tact can, so that her pride won&#8217;t be hurt? The
whole bill, surgeons, nurses, room, every possible expense;
my mother and I wish to pay it and as soon as we
can learn how much it is. Of the larger debt&mdash;that I owe
her my very life&mdash;I can&#8217;t speak yet. Time will show
me some way, I hope, to prove I&#8217;m grateful for all
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Madame! You are smiling! What can I have
said? Haven&#8217;t I offered it right? I&#8217;m glad, we&#8217;re glad,
to do much more if you will tell us what.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helen, what has put it into your head that Jessica
Trent needs any financial &#8216;help&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I really do not know. Except that all of the girls
think, or have been told, that she is one of your charity
pupils.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>Then, indeed, did Madame Mearsom laugh and
heartily:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, that is the most absurd blunder your young
heads ever made. Jessica Trent is what is called &#8216;A
Copper Princess.&#8217; She is the richest pupil I have ever
had.&#8221;</p>

<small>A TELLING VALEDICTORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Adelphi was transformed.</p>

<p>Upholsterers, florists, caterers had been so busy in all
the main rooms that when Jessica stepped into them, on
her return from hospital, she scarcely believed she had
come to the right place.</p>

<p>Yet she could not be mistaken, for a bevy of happy
girls, headed by Helen Rhinelander herself, had been
watching from the upper windows for the arrival of the
carriage that brought her; and these now swooped down
upon her with all the extravagance of greeting natural to
warm-hearted maidens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessie, you darling! So they did let you come in
time for Commencement, after all! Only last night
Madame bade us be prepared for disappointment, for one
of the hospital surgeons said he feared the effect upon
you of so much excitement. So you mustn&#8217;t get excited.
Not the least bit in the world!&#8221; And as a soothing
measure, Aubrey Huntington caught her recovered
friend around the waist and gave her a wild whirl.</p>

<p>Jessica laughed, caught her breath, began to declare
that she wasn&#8217;t&mdash;she wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;excited,&#8221; and had her
sentence finished, or smothered, by a frantic hug from
somebody else.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>Then came Natalie with the message that:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame wants Jessica in her own private room at
once. She&#8217;s afraid to trust her with us, I suppose, and I
think it&#8217;s real mean to snatch her away the very minute
she gets home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; it does seem like home, really, to be among you
all again. Only what&#8217;s been done to the rooms? They
are so beautiful, and what a lovely, lovely world it is,
to-day! Seems if there were so many places to be happy
in, so many one can call a sort of home&mdash;This, the hospital,
Ephy&#8217;s flat, and precious Sobrante. I wish&mdash;Oh!
how I wish every girl in all the world could be as happy
as I am this minute! Yes, Natalie, I&#8217;m going to Madame
right away. But I must say I wish I&#8217;d thought to ask her
to have a thin white dress made for me, too. You all
look so sweet and dainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>They escorted her to the schoolmistress, Helen herself
slipping her strong arm about the other&#8217;s waist, and
clasping Jessica&#8217;s hand, that had been so brown and was
now so thin and white, with a fervor which told how
deep her own emotion.</p>

<p>Then Madame Mearsom took her from them with a
motherly kiss and the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Exercises do not begin until ten o&#8217;clock. For the
time between, Jessie must rest quietly right here with me.
Ah! how well you all look. I am certainly proud of my
girls, to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet there was a ring of sadness in the teacher&#8217;s voice.
Some of these would leave her soon, to return no more.
They had been with her for years. She had done, or tried
to do, a mother&#8217;s part by them and she loved them. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
loved her, too, of that she was sure; but&mdash;the young
go away and forget, the old remain and remember.</p>

<p>However, it was not this wise woman&#8217;s way to cast
any shadows over other people&#8217;s sunshine; and it was
now with a gay smile that she waved them all away and
shut the door upon herself and her restored pupil. Then
she led Jessica directly to her own capacious lounge,
made her lie down, covered her lightly with a silken
spread, and bade her go to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep, dear Madame? When it&#8217;s only morning and
I&#8217;ve just come home? Why, I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you can. I command it; but first drink this bit
of bouillon that the maid has brought. Commencement
day is always an exciting one, even for the perfectly well
and strong. You are well, too, now, but not yet strong.
After your nap you shall be dressed and go to join your
mates. This is the first Commencement you have ever
attended. You will find much to interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica sat up and sipped the bouillon: then lay down
and at a fresh command obediently turned her face to
the wall. Within five minutes she was asleep; and the
next she knew, Madame was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is almost ten o&#8217;clock. I must leave you. Maid
Maria will help you in your toilet. All your things are
ready in my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica rose and entered the bedroom, where so few of
the Adelphians were ever admitted, and stared in astonishment
at Maria, holding up an exquisite frock of
sheerest white, lace-trimmed and blue-ribboned in a bewildering
fashion that showed the touch of some master
modiste.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>&#8220;Oh! how pretty? Which of the girls&#8217; is that? And
what am I to wear? My white muslin, with the two
tucks&mdash;Oh! dear! I forgot. That was left mussed last
time I wore it, at a rehearsal. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your own, Miss Trent. Madame said I was
to dress you in it. It was made from the measure of your
old frock and looks as if it would just fit. Now, if you
please. It&#8217;s getting on to time.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed too good to be true. All her schoolmates
had appeared before her, garbed in white, with the colored
ribbons of each class adorning them. These blue
ones meant that she had been promoted and must be&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Maria, if I&#8217;m to wear this pale blue that must
mean I&#8217;m now a third-former! Oh, oh, oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon &#8217;tis, Miss Trent. Promotions always are
at the end of the year, which seems funny to be called
Commencement when &#8217;tis just the other way. Ah! such
soft pretty hair you have. A pity they had to cut it short,
at that there hospital!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it a pity. Hair will grow and it&#8217;s lots
easier brushed when short. Ah! it does fit, doesn&#8217;t it?
What a dear, dear Madame! How sweet and thoughtful
of her to have it all ready without my having to ask or
wait. It is pretty, Maria! I do look nice in it, don&#8217;t I?
I mean&mdash;I&#8217;m not vain about it, but I&#8217;m so glad to look
like the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; and Madame Mearsom&#8217;s not the one to let anybody
look different from their mates. Not she. Even
the charity scholars have new things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charity scholars, Maria? Are there such in this rich
school?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>&#8220;Course. Several, or some. I don&#8217;t know how many.
I only know there are, account of paying bills for
Madame, times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! there, Miss Trent! <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know, nor nobody,
not even the charity ones themselves. Nobody knows
except Madame and the folks they belong to. Madame
says to have them and to teach them is her great privilege.
She&#8217;s found the world a place of kindness and
she&#8217;s been successful; so she just sort of passes it on.
A good woman is Madame; and now you&#8217;re ready, and
here come a lot of the girls to take you with them. Be
careful, Miss Trent. Remember you&#8217;re but just getting
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>What a day that followed!</p>

<p>In the big hall, or largest class-room, a temporary
platform had been erected and banked with the roses of
that sunny June. Behind the roses sat the Faculty. Jessica
had not known how large this was nor of how notable
presence till she saw this body of gentlemen arrayed
in a group before her. In the very place of honor sat
Madame, herself richly gowned, and far more imposing
in appearance than she had seemed in her ordinary
attire.</p>

<p>All her assistants were near her, Miss Montaigne with
the rest, smiling a tender welcome to her &#8220;special.&#8221;
There, too, a little apart from the rest, where the roses
were heaped highest, their own arms filled with flowers,
sat the seniors, the first form girls, who were to be graduated
from this school of text-books, this day, and enter
upon the larger school of life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>There was music, there was prayer, there was a brief
address. But the latter was delivered in the perfunctory
way common to such occasions and listened to with an
attention equally perfunctory.</p>

<p>It was the row of &#8220;sweet girl graduates&#8221; themselves
that alone claimed and retained the interest of everybody
in that crowding audience. Rosalie Thorne was salutatorian,
and Helen, valedictorian.</p>

<p>Rosalie acquitted herself well, with her own native
modesty and sympathetic manner, and to her, at least,
this leave taking of her old associates was a trying
ordeal.</p>

<p>It was not until the President of the Adelphi Association
had presented the diplomas that Helen Rhinelander
arose to perform her part. In the traditional manner of
valedictories, she went over many of the incidents of the
last few years, during which her own residence at the
Adelphi had continued, and brought her essay to a close
by a few telling sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Adelphi has always been known as a center of
great social influence for good, but it has never before
cherished in its midst a life-saver. Now it does. There
has come to dwell among us a girl who did not hesitate
for the fraction of a second to offer her own life to preserve
that of another, that other not her friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen paused and looked over the sea of faces yet
saw but one: the flushed, embarrassed, distressed face of
Jessica Trent; who felt that if the speaker added another
word to those which had gone before she would surely
sink in mortification. Helen, who, had now professed to
love her! Helen to do this horrid thing! To hold her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
up to the gaze of all these strangers because she had
done&mdash;Well, what anybody would have done, in the same
moment and danger!</p>

<p>But she need not have feared. Helen was neither unkind
nor indelicate, but she had a purpose in her speech
and kept on her way to disclose it, without so much as
once again glancing Jessica&#8217;s way. Neither, to that
young person&#8217;s infinite relief, did anybody else. The
orator&#8217;s reference had been too impersonal, Jessica looked
so exactly like all the other maidens in their fine attire,
that nobody not in the secret suspected who was meant
nor what was coming.</p>

<p>&#8220;When one has a heroine for a neighbor, one naturally
looks up to that person and wishes to please her. Our
life-saving, life-sacrificing heroine had often expressed
a certain wish. We have all heard it, ignored it, or forgotten
it, until her brave act reawakened a desire to
gratify her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, it seems, she visited a certain poor quarter of
this city where little children swarmed in the gutters and
wretched mothers were forced by ill-paid toil to neglect
these helpless little ones. They have been forgotten by
the rest of us; their desperate poverty has mocked at our
abundance; there has been none to give them a thought,
except our young heroine whose repeated assertion has
been: &#8216;When I grow up, if I can in any way get the
money, I will build homes for such poor babies. They
shall have big airy rooms with kind nurses to attend them.
They shall have plenty of toys, <i>plenty</i> of toys, plenty of
everything to make them grow up good and not wicked.
How can they help being wicked, living as they do?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>&#8217;
So she has often talked and we have listened, as to the
dreams of a child, unknowing whereof she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is changed. The girl who would lay down
her life for another is not a dreamer, she is a practical
Christian. And now I, whose life was that one saved,
desire to gratify her wish, her dream, if you please, to
make it happy reality. I will be one to start a home for
those gutter babies, regretting only that I cannot accomplish
the work without asking help from others, and
I do it for love of this dear, dreaming heroine.</p>

<p>&#8220;To build a home and equip it for the children of
Avenue A and its swarming tenements I now open a subscription
list and head the same with five thousand dollars.
Who comes next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was no longer abashed nor self-conscious. All
her heart was in the scene that ensued, when Madame
followed that eloquent appeal with her own subscription
of five thousand. She was well-known as a fairly rich
woman and, in proportion to her means, for an extremely
liberal one. Therefore, nobody except the &#8220;heroine&#8221; herself
was greatly surprised by her action: but there were
others in that rose-adorned hall who loved Madame and
had been trained by her. Old pupils that were now, some
of them, growing gray-headed women, but who still
reverenced their old instructress and followed where
she led.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two thousand,&#8221; said one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten. Put me down for ten thousand, Miss Rhinelander,&#8221;
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even one thousand will help. It takes a heap of
money to build a substantial &#8216;home&#8217; in this city and I&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
like to make it more. But my subscription is, for the
present, one thousand dollars. Have you my name correct,
Miss Rhinelander,&#8221; cried still a third.</p>

<p>Experienced persons say that sympathy goes in waves.
Many a big sum has been raised by the sympathetic wave
set in motion just as this one has been; and, before the
benediction was pronounced over that assembly, sufficient
money had been guaranteed to make the dream of Jessica
Trent a future reality.</p>

<p>As for that happy girl, she could not at all realize this
fact, though her fancy had again returned to the pitiful
small faces which she had never forgotten and always
hoped to help. Not till Helen sought her and drew her
into a quiet spot did she begin to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Jessica dear, I thought, well I thought you
were a &#8216;charity&#8217; and I told Madame that I wanted to pay
for all your stay in the hospital. Then she told me that
you were, or would be, a great deal richer than any of us;
and she suggested that if I wanted to please you I could
best do it by furthering some of your &#8216;dreams&#8217; about
other people. Then I remembered hearing the girls talk
of your being so touched by the Avenue A babies, and
I hoped that since I couldn&#8217;t do anything for you, personally,
I might for them. That&#8217;s all. My part is a thank-offering.
I think all the rest is pure charity. Are you
glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad, Helen? I&#8217;m so glad I can hardly breathe. And
I can almost hear my mother saying: &#8216;Just a link in life&#8217;s
chain, Jessica.&#8217; I, Buster I mean, ran away and I went
to Avenue A. Just a little thing like that, yet out of it
came&mdash;all this! Oh! isn&#8217;t it grand? isn&#8217;t it beautiful just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
to be alive, helping in the &#8216;chain,&#8217; seeing the happiness
grow! Oh! I thank you, Helen, more than words can
tell. And&mdash;and how soon do you think that home can be
built? Do you suppose I&#8217;ll see it done before I, too,
graduate? I can hardly wait till I get a chance to write
home to my mother and ask her to put her own name
down on that list. She will, she&#8217;ll help. O Helen!
What a happy day this is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But a sad one, too. Just as I begin to know
you I must lose you. Even now, within this hour. My
mother is waiting&mdash;Good-by, good-by!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br />


<small>THE DREAM AND THE REALITY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> ended Jessica Trent&#8217;s first year at school. It
was the forerunner of others so like it that no record
is needed. There were summer vacation trips in various
directions, visits to the homes of schoolmates, and one
year&mdash;the third of her absence from Sobrante&mdash;was
spent in Europe.</p>

<p>The intimacy with Aubrey and Natalie begun on her
entrance to the Adelphi, continued through all their
mutual course and at last the time came when they, too,
were to be graduated; strangely enough, Aubrey with
first honors and our heroine with none. She wrote
home:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to be dreadfully disappointed in me, I
know, and I wish, I wish I could make it otherwise. But
I can&#8217;t. I think all that feverish energy of the first year
was but a &#8216;spurt,&#8217; as rowers say. It came from shame.
But as soon as I had picked up enough to keep even with
the girls of my own age I couldn&#8217;t tear ahead and climb
any more of that &#8216;bean-stalk&#8217; dear Miss Montaigne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
used to talk about. Poor thing! She feels a deal worse
about my stupidity than I do. She thought she had
found a genius to instruct when she first took hold of my
brains, but she made a mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can sing&mdash;a little. I can fiddle, or violin, enough to
make it pleasant for the &#8216;boys&#8217; when I get home. I can
sew a seam and I&#8217;ve never forgotten Aunt Sally&#8217;s parting
injunction to &#8216;keep my stockings mended.&#8217; I can
set a table, I can entertain a guest, I&#8217;ve been through the
cooking class and can do an omelet or a Welsh rarebit to
a turn. I&#8217;ve studied banking and economy till I think,
I hope, I can take care of a good deal of your business;
or, at least, can see that nobody carries it on badly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can trim a bonnet, I can make a gown, and I can
wash fine laces. Aubrey says she doesn&#8217;t see what
Madame&#8217;s pupils need of such &#8216;accomplishments,&#8217; but
Madame, who is wise, says one never can tell what one
may or may not need to know. Anyway, it was her place
to give us an all around education and she&#8217;s done her best
for us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can speak French and German well enough to act
as interpreter on our trip abroad, and I&#8217;ve hammered
enough Latin into my head to understand Botany and a
bit of mineralogy. But I don&#8217;t yet see how long it would
take Mr. A, working so many hours a day to be as smart
as Mr. B, working some other time. Arithmetic isn&#8217;t my
strong point.</p>

<p>&#8220;In brief, dearest mother, you&#8217;ll find your girl is just
a plain, home-loving, people-loving, glad-to-be-alive-and-a-link-in-the-chain
sort of creature; and thus forewarned
you&#8217;re not to be so greatly, greatly disappointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
if you please. I&#8217;m not a &#8216;star,&#8217; as you were; not even
that bottom-of-the-class-one I sometimes aspired to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your room is all ready. You are to stay right here
at the Adelphi while you are in town. Madame, my second
mother, will hear of no other arrangement; and, dear,
she has promised she will accept your invitation to go
home with us to Sobrante and stay all summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last evening we went to a sort of farewell reception
at the &#8216;Adelphi Home for Children,&#8217; our blessed sanctuary
for the little ones over on Avenue A. As I looked
at that great building, with all its fine appointments, its
comfort and its hosts of happy babies, I got&mdash;as I used
to say when I was a baby myself&mdash;&#8216;all chokey up.&#8217; And
I sighted backward along the &#8216;chain&#8217; to that far-away
afternoon when Buster laid its corner stone, so to speak.
Knocking down one little maid from Avenue A was the
real beginning of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be in time for Sophy&#8217;s graduation, too. She
is so strong and well now, and such an ideal nurse.
They&#8217;re going to miss her dreadfully at St. Luke&#8217;s which
has been her home so long. The Superintendent told me
there was nobody who could manage a fractious patient
with the skill and tenderness of our dear Sophy. She&#8217;s
the real honor girl of our family. It seems to me there
isn&#8217;t anything in the realm of nursing that she hasn&#8217;t
conquered. The head surgeon says she could even perform
one of those fearful &#8216;operations&#8217; if necessary,
though I hope it never will be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should see the darling&#8217;s pride in her new, white
linen uniforms. All her old blue gingham, &#8216;probationer&#8217;
ones she is leaving for any other girl who wants to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
nurse and hasn&#8217;t money for her clothes. You&#8217;d think it
was bridal finery to see Sophy handle those garments:
see her fondle the spotless aprons and dainty caps; and
hear her murmur: &#8216;At last, at last! I am authorized and
free to do for others what has been done for me!&#8217; She
looks so pretty, so earnest, so noble, that I&#8217;m sure some
of our &#8216;boys&#8217; will want to break a bone or two just to
have her attend them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve paid my last visit, too, to Granny Briggs in her
apartment. She is as happy as Sophy and as proud, but
far more weighed down with the cares of life. &#8216;What
will I do with this here painted plate, what Miss Montaigne
first et Indian puddin&#8217; off?&#8217; &#8216;Them granite
pots &#8217;t Ephraim Marsh bought, and don&#8217;t need scourin&#8217;
all the time, I certain can&#8217;t leave them behind to be
thrown into a rubbish heap!&#8217; Ephraim sits and chuckles
and says that he too, &#8216;at last, is on the road to freedom.
Sophia Badger that was has badgered the life out of him
&#8217;cause he&#8217;s so forgetful and will eat stuff no man of his
age ought to, though it&#8217;s never hurt him a mite. Fire
the whole mess of trash into the garbage box, Sophia,
and let the poor ash-man get the benefit of &#8217;em. We
don&#8217;t need no New York truck on our ranch, Sophia.
We&#8217;re going home to Sobrante.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dear old fellow is as happy as a child; but, mother
darling, there&#8217;s a lump in my throat every time I hear him
say that sweet word &#8216;home.&#8217; He <i>is</i> going. He <i>must</i>
hold out till he gets there and maybe, oh! maybe, the
&#8216;superfine air of Californy, where folks live to be a hundred
and fifteen years old, some of &#8217;em,&#8217; may put that
new life into his veins that he anticipates. But there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
moments when my eyes fill looking on his blessed, honest,
rugged face and I see how worn and thin it is. &#8216;Sophia
Badger&#8217; sees the change in him, as well. She has never
said so and I would not ask her if she did. I couldn&#8217;t
bear to hear my own fear put into words. She merely
cossets him and feeds him and scolds him more than
ever; yet does it all with that maternal smile that makes
my heart ache. The two poor, dear old creatures! Who
still talk of their childhood &#8216;scrapes&#8217; in &#8216;Cawnco&#8217;d&#8217; as
if it were but yesterday. Ephraim has sent up-river for
Buster and that happy broncho is also ready for his
homeward trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Altogether, we shall be, <i>must</i> be a merry, merry
party; and I can hardly realize that I have come to a
time when I am writing my very last letter to you. Before
another one could reach you we shall be together,
face to face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till then, and hoping you are duly prepared for the
girl you haven&#8217;t seen in five long years&mdash;just because you
thought it wiser and better for me that I should mature
outside the family garden&mdash;I bring this long one to a
close.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;Your daughter,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Jessica</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Commencements are much alike. This one that witnessed
Jessica Trent&#8217;s graduation, might have been any
other of her whole school course, so far as outward
appearances went. There were the same artistic decorations,
the same superabundance of flowers, the same
well-spread tables. There was almost the same old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
crowd of eager spectators so like were these to the
gatherings gone before.</p>

<p>But there was always, as there always will be, a great
difference to the maidens most concerned.</p>

<p>To Jessica&#8217;s vast astonishment, she had been chosen
valedictorian of her class; and with a fine ambition that
here, at least, she might make her mother proud, she had
worked night and day on her essay and had brought it
to what even Madame pronounced a fine and graceful
climax. Jessie had a gift of speech and she had a gift of
pen; but&mdash; Let us not forecast!</p>

<p>Almost the same Faculty occupied the platform. Almost
the same teachers sat beside the stately Madame;
and almost the same group of white-clad maidens waited
with fluttering hearts for their bit of sheepskin which the
President would soon present them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent was there, grown scarcely old in these past
years, because of the greater ease and luxury of her life.
Madam Dalrymple, in shimmering silk and coiffure quite
as bewildering as when her young &#8220;second cousin twice
removed&#8221; had first beheld her. She had made the long
trans-continental journey&mdash;&#8220;I left my rheumatism behind
me in that dry air of California&#8221;&mdash;to witness a
scene which would bring back that one when Gabriella,
beloved of her heart, had also graduated. She even
&#8220;Poohs!&#8221; at that mother&#8217;s disappointment in that Jessica
is not a world-famous scholar. &#8220;Why, what do you
want, Gabriella? The child is a gentlewoman&mdash;one
glance shows it&mdash;and the only &#8216;career&#8217; to which she
need aspire is to make our home a real home, back there
at Sobrante. Leave the scholarship to Ned. That boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
has reached the necktie stage of his existence and begins
to think about his hair and finger nails. He has brains
enough, else he&#8217;d never have been so mischievous. Don&#8217;t
worry because Jessica isn&#8217;t a mannish woman, but be
content. For my part, I never saw a more beautiful,
wholly satisfactory girl. You couldn&#8217;t hold a candle to
her even in your earliest youth; and now you see how
good my judgment was. If I hadn&#8217;t fairly nagged you
into sending her to me you&#8217;d never have seen such a
picture as that yon,&#8221; finished the delighted dame, nodding
her white pompadour stage-ward.</p>

<p>Ephraim was there, Mrs. Briggs and Sophy beside
him; all in that same front row with Mrs. Dalrymple
and Gabriella; also a young lad who is taking his first
peep at life outside his home and whom the valedictorian
can scarcely believe is the scampish little &#8220;tacker&#8221; she
remembers, even Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Jessie. Do us credit,&#8221; whispers Miss Montaigne,
as the fateful moment arrives and the girl steps
forward to repeat the speech she has so carefully memorised.
She is a &#8220;dream of beauty,&#8221; as Madam Dalrymple
has declared. Her movements are graceful and easy.
She wears her exquisite graduation gown as unconsciously
as if it were her ordinary school frock, and that
Madame has, also, said is to be a mark of gentlehood.
&#8220;Such people are clothed&mdash;they never wear their
clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica bows, very prettily, very low. She opens her
lips and a word or two issues thence. Then, most unfortunately,
she lifts her eyes toward a group of other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
girls, with whom she has joyed and sorrowed during the
close intimacy of these past years and&mdash;disaster!</p>

<p>Her eyes fill, her face flushes, pales, is covered by her
slim white hands&mdash;and Jessica Trent has ignominiously
broken down. A fierce sob escapes her&mdash;is taken up and
echoed by one, a half-dozen, all of those white throats of
her beloved mates, and they are all weeping in concert.
Even some of the audience, moved by a profound sympathy,
shed a few tears in concert; and&mdash;Commencement
is over!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there generally is some unusual happening to
mark the close of our year together, but we&#8217;ve never had
just this sort of thing before; and it&#8217;s all because we
never before graduated a girl whose whole nature was
just <i>love</i>!&#8221; said poor Miss Montaigne, whose own heart
was heavy at this parting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sobrante?</p>

<p>Yes, at last. The special or private car, also the
&#8220;Sobrante,&#8221; is slowly approaching the terminal of the
railway&mdash;the Sobrante mines. It is also an observation
car and its open spaces are crowded with such eager people
as never before journeyed over that route. Old faces,
young faces, but never a sad nor lonely face among
them; and happiest of all is Jessica Trent&#8217;s.</p>

<p>With trembling lips she questions Ninian Sharp as she
has used to do in the days before she was a &#8220;young
lady&#8221;; and he who has met her and all the returning
party at Los Angeles answers as swiftly as she asks:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>&#8220;What is that big stone building crowning the mesa,
old Pedro&#8217;s mesa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our new St. Luke&#8217;s hospital; over which your friend
Miss Sophy is to rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That spire? Is that a <i>church</i>, right here at our own
dear home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The Church of the Good Shepherd&mdash;Who has
cared for His unfortunates,&#8221; replies the mine manager,
lifting his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That long low building, in the valley, where the
raisin-grapes used to grow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you haven&#8217;t forgotten localities, I see. That&#8217;s
our library, reading-room, bowling alley, amusement
place in general.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That other, of red brick with white trimmings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our school; one of the best equipped and officered in
southern California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those cottages? Such rows and rows of them, each
with its bit of green about it&mdash;Who lives in them?
Where have the people come from? you must have irrigated
well and lavishly to make so much verdure here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The miners&#8217;, carpenters&#8217;, and farmers&#8217; homes. Yes,
we&#8217;ve water now and to spare. We tapped it in the
mountains, an ever-constant flow, and water you will
remember, Miss Jessica, is a &#8216;mine&#8217; in itself to California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere, everywhere, such changes and so fine!
Yet it almost grieves me to come home and find it all so
changed. But that is wrong. It is the dream of my dead
father&#8217;s life made blessed reality. So, I am glad after
all, and I feel that from somewhere he is looking down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
on me returning, bidding me take up and carry on the
work he planned, that you have organized, and that old
Pedro&#8217;s gift made possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! here we are! And <i>this</i> is unchanged! This
dear old &#8216;house&#8217; is not one bit different from my memory
of it! Home, home, at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she sprang from the car and sped across the little
intervening space which yet remained, there issued from
that cottage door a plump old lady, decorated everywhere
with strips of flying patchwork, her glasses on top of her
old gray head, and a bottle in her hand, which so shakes
with delight that the vial falls to the ground and breaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jess&mdash;All that good picry&mdash;Jessie, my love, my
lamb! Luis! Wun Lung! John, Marty, Ephraim
Ma&#8217;sh&mdash;man alive you needed that medicine, you needed
it powerful, and it&#8217;s wasted! Never mind, I&#8217;ve got more
and after supper&mdash;Wun Lung, do you dast tell me you
come out and left them &#8216;sally luns&#8217; to scorch? Back into
that kitchen and serve up that supper or I&#8217;ll cut your pigtail
off!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this dire and oft-repeated threat the Chinaman
disappeared, salaaming and katowing to the last, as he retreated
backward and fixed his admiring gaze upon the
girl he had known and always loved.</p>

<p>But why seek to describe that joyful homecoming?
Those who have home-loving hearts may well imagine
it for themselves; and those who have not would not be
interested.</p>

<p>But never was there, could there be, a more grateful
heart than Jessica Trent&#8217;s, as she stood that night before
her own old, open window and looked out over that vast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
estate of which she was to be the chatelaine; while from
her lips there rose the humble, happy cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;O Thou dear God Who givest all, make me to be
worthy of my Inheritance!&#8221;</p>

<h3>BURT L. STANDISH.</h3>

<p class="center">No modern series of tales for boys and youths has met with anything

Merriwell Stories. There must be a reason for this and there is.
Frank Merriwell, as portrayed by the author, is a jolly whole-souled,
honest, courageous American lad, who appeals to the hearts of the
boys. He has no bad habits, and his manliness inculcates the idea
that it is not necessary for a boy to indulge in petty vices to be a hero.
Frank Merriwell&#8217;s example is a shining light for every ambitious lad
to follow. Ten volumes now ready:</p>
